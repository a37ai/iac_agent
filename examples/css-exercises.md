#### >  /add animation/03-dropdown-menu/README.md  
_Added animation/03-dropdown-menu/README.md to the chat_  

Yes, I see the content of the `animation/03-dropdown-menu/README.md` file. It describes an exercise to add animation to a dropdown menu, creating a bounce illusion when the dropdown expands close to its final end state. The desired outcome is shown in a GIF file, and the hints provided suggest using the `transform-origin` property and adding an intermediate step to the keyframe at-rule to achieve the bounce effect.

Is there any specific change or improvement you would like me to make to this file or any other file in the repository?

#### >  can you make the changes suggested in the readme?  

To make the changes suggested in the `animation/03-dropdown-menu/README.md`, I need to see the contents of the following files:

1. `animation/03-dropdown-menu/style.css`
2. `animation/03-dropdown-menu/script.js`

Please provide the contents of these files so I can suggest the necessary changes.

_animation/03-dropdown-menu/style.css_  
_animation/03-dropdown-menu/script.js_  
_Add these files to the chat? y_  

Apologies for the oversight. I see the content of the `animation/03-dropdown-menu/style.css` and `animation/03-dropdown-menu/script.js` files now. I will suggest the necessary changes to add the bounce animation to the dropdown menu.

```css
animation/03-dropdown-menu/style.css
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
.visible {
  display: block;
}
=======
.visible {
  display: block;
  animation: expand 0.3s ease-out;
  transform-origin: top;
}

@keyframes expand {
  0% {
    transform: scaleY(0);
  }
  80% {
    transform: scaleY(1.1);
  }
  100% {
    transform: scaleY(1);
  }
}
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

These changes add the bounce animation to the dropdown menu by creating a new keyframe animation called `expand`. The `transform-origin` property is set to `top` to make the dropdown menu start transforming from the top. The intermediate step at 80% of the animation creates the bounce illusion.

_Applied edit to animation/03-dropdown-menu/style.css_  
_Commit bb3a813 aider: Added bounce animation to dropdown menu._
