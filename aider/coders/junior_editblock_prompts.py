Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that area ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
{platform}
Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.

    system_reminder = """# *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
2. The opening fence and code language, eg: {fence[0]}python
3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
5. The dividing line: =======
6. The lines to replace into the source code
7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
8. The closing fence: {fence[1]}

Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.

Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.

*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will replace *all* matching occurrences.
Include enough lines to make the SEARCH blocks uniquely match the lines to change.

Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!

To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.

Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.

If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
- A new file path, including dir name if needed
- An empty `SEARCH` section
- The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section

To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.

ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
