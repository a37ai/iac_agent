Confirm this is the desired region or update as needed.   - `ami_id`: Ensure this is set to a valid AMI ID for the desired operating system (e.g., Ubuntu)./commit

# Provision an EC2 instance in AWS
This Terraform configuration provisions an EC2 instance in AWS.

## Details
By default, this configuration provisions a Ubuntu 14.04 Base Image AMI (with ID ami-2e1ef954) with type t2.micro in the us-east-1 region. The AMI ID, region, and type can all be set as variables. You can also set the name variable to determine the value set for the Name tag.

Note that you need to set environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.

#### ### Implementation Plan for User Query: Create a Virtual Machine on AWS#### Step 1: Update the `main.tf` File1. **Open `main.tf`**: This file contains the main configuration for Terraform.2. **Modify the `aws_instance` Resource**:   - Ensure the `aws_instance` resource is configured to create a virtual machine (VM) on AWS.   - Update the `ami` and `instance_type` to match the user's requirements for a small-scale infrastructure.   - Set the `availability_zone` to `${var.aws_region}a` as per the user's preference for a specific region.   - Ensure the `tags` block follows the naming convention `project-name-resource-type`.#### Step 2: Update the `variables.tf` File1. **Open `variables.tf`**: This file defines the variables used in the Terraform configuration.2. **Ensure Variables are Defined**:   - `aws_region`: Already defined with a default of `us-west-1`. Confirm this is the desired region or update as needed.   - `ami_id`: Ensure this is set to a valid AMI ID for the desired operating system (e.g., Ubuntu)./commit  

To implement the changes for creating a virtual machine on AWS, we need to update the `main.tf` file to ensure the `aws_instance` resource is correctly configured. We will also ensure the `variables.tf` file has the necessary variables defined.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for the changes:

main.tf
```hcl
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  ami           = "${var.ami_id}"
  instance_type = "${var.instance_type}"
  availability_zone = "${var.aws_region}a"

  tags = {
    Name = "${var.name}"
  }
=======
  ami           = var.ami_id
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  availability_zone = "${var.aws_region}a"

  tags = {
    Name = "${var.name}"
    Project = "my-project"
    Resource = "vm"
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

variables.tf
```hcl
<<<<<<< SEARCH
variable "ami_id" {
  description = "ID of the AMI to provision. Default is Ubuntu 14.04 Base Image"
  default = "ami-05c65d8bb2e35991a"
}

variable "instance_type" {
  description = "type of EC2 instance to provision."
  default = "t2.micro"
}
=======
variable "ami_id" {
  description = "ID of the AMI to provision. Default is Ubuntu 14.04 Base Image"
  default = "ami-05c65d8bb2e35991a"
}

variable "instance_type" {
  description = "type of EC2 instance to provision."
  default = "t2.micro"
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes ensure that the `aws_instance` resource is configured with the appropriate AMI ID, instance type, and tags following the naming convention `project-name-resource-type`. The variables are already defined correctly in `variables.tf`.

To implement the changes for creating a virtual machine on AWS, we need to ensure that the `aws_instance` resource in `main.tf` is correctly configured. Let's make sure the AMI ID and instance type are set according to your requirements, and that the tags follow the naming convention.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for the necessary changes:

main.tf
```hcl
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  ami           = var.ami_id
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  availability_zone = "${var.aws_region}a"

  tags = {
    Name = "${var.name}"
    Project = "my-project"
    Resource = "vm"
  }
=======
  ami           = var.ami_id
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  availability_zone = "${var.aws_region}a"

  tags = {
    Name = "${var.name}"
    Project = "user-project"
    Resource = "vm"
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the `aws_instance` resource is configured with the correct AMI ID, instance type, and follows the naming convention for tags. If you need to update the AMI ID or instance type, you can modify the `variables.tf` file accordingly. Let me know if you need further adjustments!

This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
published from being rewound.

The workflow assumed here is:

 * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).

 * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.

 * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
   branches, merge them into "next" branch.

The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.

With this workflow, you would want to know:

(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
    not want to rewind it.

(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
    change things related to the topic as patches against your
    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
    tip of "master".

Let's look at this example:

		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
		  /       /           /           /
		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
		/   /               /           /
	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
	      /   /   /             \         /
	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
	    /   /   /   /             \     /
    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"


A, B and C are topic branches.

 * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".

 * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
   and is ready to be deleted.

 * C has not merged to "next" at all.

We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
B to be deleted.

To compute (1):

	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
	git rev-list ^master        next

	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.

To compute (2):

	git rev-list master..topic

	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

# branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.

# For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
# in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
# with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
# essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
# branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
# not interfere with the difference between the branches.

# The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
# for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in
# the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.
#
# Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,
# not from the working tree, so if you want to perform operations on
# the working tree, you will have to adapt your code accordingly, e.g.
# by adding "cd .." or using relative paths.
