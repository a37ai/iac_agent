# Troubleshooting

Below are some approaches for troubleshooting problems with aider.
If you need more help, please file a
[GitHub issue]()
or drop into our
[Discord]().

When reporting problems, it is very helpful if you can provide:

- Aider version
- LLM model you are using

The easiest way to do that is to copy the "announcement" lines that
aider prints when you run it:

```
Aider v0.37.1-dev
Models: gpt-4o with diff edit format, weak model gpt-3.5-turbo
Git repo: .git with 243 files
Repo-map: using 1024 tokens
```
