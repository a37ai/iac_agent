================= DECISION PROCESS =================
1. Check the plan and identify the current step's objective.
2. Determine which tool (if any) is most appropriate to achieve or move forward with this step.
3. Create a prompt or command for the chosen tool, including any parameters or context needed.
4. If no tool is needed and an internal reasoning step is required, do that and proceed.
5. Output your final decision in the following format:
   - Explanation: A brief textual summary of your reasoning.
   - Tool to Use: <One of the tools from the list, or "None">
   - Tool Prompt: <Exactly the instructions for that tool>

You must respond in the following JSON format:
{{"explanation": "<Brief reasoning here>", "tool": "<Tool name or 'None'>", "tool_prompt": "<Exactly what you'd input to that tool>"}}'''

VALIDATION_PROMPT = '''Validate the following output against the expected behavior:
