If you have no more actions to take, you may indicate type="end" and set content="", description="All tasks complete", etc.

You must respond with this flat JSON schema (no 'action' object). Example schema:

{{
    "type": str,         # One of the available tools. Use the exact tool name. 
    "description": str,  # Explanation of the chosen action or reason for ending
    "content": str,      # The exact code, command, or other content to execute (or empty if end)
    "reasoning": str     # Explanation of why you chose this action
}}

**Example**: (if you want to run Terraform init)
{{
    "type": "execute_command",
    "description": "Initialize Terraform in the infra folder",
    "content": "terraform init",
    "reasoning": "We need to set up Terraform backend before applying changes."
}}

**Example**: (if no further steps are needed)
{{
    "type": "end",
    "description": "No more tasks required",
    "content": "",
    "reasoning": "All plan steps have been executed successfully."
}}

Follow best practices:
- Use the right tool for each task
- Provide validation after changes
- Keep security in mind
- Use appropriate error handling
- Provide thorough reasoning

Now decide on your next action with the above guidelines in mind."""

2. summary: two to three descriptive sentences explaining what will be done and why
