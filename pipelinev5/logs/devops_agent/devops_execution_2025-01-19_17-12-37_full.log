  "codebase_context": "Overview:\n# Comprehensive Overview of the Mono Repository\n\n## 1. Overall Architecture\n\n### High-level System Design\nThe repository is structured to provision AWS infrastructure using Terraform, specifically focusing on deploying an EC2 instance. The design follows a modular approach, with separate files for defining variables, outputs, and the main configuration.\n\n### Design Patterns and Principles\n- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The repository employs IaC principles using Terraform, enabling version-controlled and repeatable infrastructure deployments.\n- **Separation of Concerns:** Different aspects of the configuration (variables, outputs, main configuration) are separated into distinct files, promoting clarity and maintainability.\n\n### System Boundaries and Interfaces\n- **Interfaces:** The primary interface is the Terraform CLI, which interacts with AWS APIs to provision resources.\n- **Boundaries:** The system boundary is defined by the AWS infrastructure components managed by Terraform, specifically the EC2 instance.\n\n## 2. Development Infrastructure\n\n### Technology Stack\n- **Terraform:** Used for defining and provisioning infrastructure.\n- **AWS:** The cloud provider where resources are deployed.\n\n### Key Dependencies\n- **Terraform CLI:** Required for executing the Terraform scripts.\n- **AWS Provider for Terraform:** Facilitates interaction with AWS services.\n\n### Development Tools and Requirements\n- **Terraform Version:** Specified in the `main.tf` file.\n- **AWS Credentials:** Managed through environment variables for authentication and authorization.\n\n## 3. DevOps Infrastructure\n\n### Deployment Architecture\n- **Infrastructure as Code Setup:** Utilizes Terraform scripts to define and automate the deployment of AWS resources.\n- **Configuration Management Approach:** Managed through Terraform's variable and output mechanisms.\n\n### Service Dependencies and Integration Points\n- **AWS Services:** The primary dependency is on AWS EC2, with potential for integration with other AWS services as needed.\n\n## 4. Environment Management\n\n### Development, Staging, and Production Environments\n- The repository currently does not explicitly define separate environments. However, Terraform's variable system allows for environment-specific configurations.\n\n### Environment-specific Configurations\n- **Variables:** Defined in `variables.tf`, allowing customization for different environments.\n\n### Environment Promotion Strategy\n- Not explicitly defined, but can be managed through Terraform workspaces or separate state files for different environments.\n\n### Configuration and Secret Management\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for managing AWS credentials, ensuring sensitive information is not hard-coded.\n\n## 5. CI/CD Pipeline\n\n### Build and Deployment Processes\n- The repository does not currently include a CI/CD pipeline setup. However, it can be integrated with tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.\n\n### Testing Strategies\n- **Terraform Plan:** Can be used to preview changes before applying them, serving as a basic form of testing.\n\n### Deployment Strategies\n- **Direct Deployment:** Current setup suggests direct deployment without advanced strategies like blue-green or canary.\n\n### Release Management\n- Not explicitly defined within the repository.\n\n## 6. Operational Considerations\n\n### Monitoring and Logging Setup\n- Not detailed in the repository. AWS CloudWatch could be integrated for monitoring and logging.\n\n### Security Measures\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for managing sensitive credentials.\n- **IAM Roles and Policies:** Should be considered for securing access to AWS resources.\n\n### Scalability Provisions\n- **EC2 Instance Type and AMI:** Configurable through variables, allowing for scaling by changing instance types or counts.\n\n### Backup and Disaster Recovery\n- Not explicitly defined. AWS services like EBS snapshots or AMI backups could be utilized.\n\n## 7. Areas for Improvement\n\n### Technical Debt\n- **Documentation:** Enhance README with detailed setup and usage instructions.\n- **Environment Management:** Implement a strategy for managing multiple environments.\n\n### Security Considerations\n- **Secret Management:** Consider using AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault for managing sensitive information.\n- **IAM Policies:** Review and restrict permissions to the minimum necessary.\n\n### Scalability Concerns\n- **Auto-scaling:** Consider implementing AWS Auto Scaling for EC2 instances.\n\n### DevOps Pipeline Optimization\n- **CI/CD Integration:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.\n- **Testing:** Incorporate automated testing for Terraform configurations.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the repository can be enhanced to support more robust, secure, and scalable infrastructure deployments.\n\nFile Structure:\n{\"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate.backup\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/outputs.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/main.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/README.md\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/variables.tf\": \"file\"}\n\nRelevant Files:\n{\n  \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/main.tf\": \"terraform {\\n  required_version = \\\">= 0.11.0\\\"\\n}\\n\\nprovider \\\"aws\\\" {\\n  region = \\\"${var.aws_region}\\\"\\n}\\n\\nresource \\\"aws_instance\\\" \\\"ubuntu\\\" {\\n  ami           = \\\"${var.ami_id}\\\"\\n  instance_type = \\\"${var.instance_type}\\\"\\n  availability_zone = \\\"${var.aws_region}a\\\"\\n\\n  tags {\\n    Name = \\\"${var.name}\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n\"\n}\n",

  "codebase_context": "Overview:\n# Comprehensive Overview of the Mono Repository\n\n## 1. Overall Architecture\n\n### High-level System Design\nThe repository is structured to provision AWS infrastructure using Terraform, specifically focusing on deploying an EC2 instance. The design follows a modular approach, with separate files for defining variables, outputs, and the main configuration.\n\n### Design Patterns and Principles\n- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The repository employs IaC principles using Terraform, enabling version-controlled and repeatable infrastructure deployments.\n- **Separation of Concerns:** Different aspects of the configuration (variables, outputs, main configuration) are separated into distinct files, promoting clarity and maintainability.\n\n### System Boundaries and Interfaces\n- **Interfaces:** The primary interface is the Terraform CLI, which interacts with AWS APIs to provision resources.\n- **Boundaries:** The system boundary is defined by the AWS infrastructure components managed by Terraform, specifically the EC2 instance.\n\n## 2. Development Infrastructure\n\n### Technology Stack\n- **Terraform:** Used for defining and provisioning infrastructure.\n- **AWS:** The cloud provider where resources are deployed.\n\n### Key Dependencies\n- **Terraform CLI:** Required for executing the Terraform scripts.\n- **AWS Provider for Terraform:** Facilitates interaction with AWS services.\n\n### Development Tools and Requirements\n- **Terraform Version:** Specified in the `main.tf` file.\n- **AWS Credentials:** Managed through environment variables for authentication and authorization.\n\n## 3. DevOps Infrastructure\n\n### Deployment Architecture\n- **Infrastructure as Code Setup:** Utilizes Terraform scripts to define and automate the deployment of AWS resources.\n- **Configuration Management Approach:** Managed through Terraform's variable and output mechanisms.\n\n### Service Dependencies and Integration Points\n- **AWS Services:** The primary dependency is on AWS EC2, with potential for integration with other AWS services as needed.\n\n## 4. Environment Management\n\n### Development, Staging, and Production Environments\n- The repository currently does not explicitly define separate environments. However, Terraform's variable system allows for environment-specific configurations.\n\n### Environment-specific Configurations\n- **Variables:** Defined in `variables.tf`, allowing customization for different environments.\n\n### Environment Promotion Strategy\n- Not explicitly defined, but can be managed through Terraform workspaces or separate state files for different environments.\n\n### Configuration and Secret Management\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for managing AWS credentials, ensuring sensitive information is not hard-coded.\n\n## 5. CI/CD Pipeline\n\n### Build and Deployment Processes\n- The repository does not currently include a CI/CD pipeline setup. However, it can be integrated with tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.\n\n### Testing Strategies\n- **Terraform Plan:** Can be used to preview changes before applying them, serving as a basic form of testing.\n\n### Deployment Strategies\n- **Direct Deployment:** Current setup suggests direct deployment without advanced strategies like blue-green or canary.\n\n### Release Management\n- Not explicitly defined within the repository.\n\n## 6. Operational Considerations\n\n### Monitoring and Logging Setup\n- Not detailed in the repository. AWS CloudWatch could be integrated for monitoring and logging.\n\n### Security Measures\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for managing sensitive credentials.\n- **IAM Roles and Policies:** Should be considered for securing access to AWS resources.\n\n### Scalability Provisions\n- **EC2 Instance Type and AMI:** Configurable through variables, allowing for scaling by changing instance types or counts.\n\n### Backup and Disaster Recovery\n- Not explicitly defined. AWS services like EBS snapshots or AMI backups could be utilized.\n\n## 7. Areas for Improvement\n\n### Technical Debt\n- **Documentation:** Enhance README with detailed setup and usage instructions.\n- **Environment Management:** Implement a strategy for managing multiple environments.\n\n### Security Considerations\n- **Secret Management:** Consider using AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault for managing sensitive information.\n- **IAM Policies:** Review and restrict permissions to the minimum necessary.\n\n### Scalability Concerns\n- **Auto-scaling:** Consider implementing AWS Auto Scaling for EC2 instances.\n\n### DevOps Pipeline Optimization\n- **CI/CD Integration:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.\n- **Testing:** Incorporate automated testing for Terraform configurations.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the repository can be enhanced to support more robust, secure, and scalable infrastructure deployments.\n\nFile Structure:\n{\"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate.backup\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/outputs.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/main.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/README.md\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/variables.tf\": \"file\"}\n\nRelevant Files:\n{\n  \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/main.tf\": \"terraform {\\n  required_version = \\\">= 0.11.0\\\"\\n}\\n\\nresource \\\"aws_instance\\\" \\\"dev_instance\\\" {\\n  ami           = var.ami_id\\n  instance_type = \\\"t2.micro\\\"\\n  tags = {\\n    Name = \\\"Development-Instance\\\"\\n  }\\n  # Using default security group and no key pair as specified\\n}\\n\\nprovider \\\"aws\\\" {\\n  region = \\\"${var.aws_region}\\\"\\n}\\n\\nresource \\\"aws_instance\\\" \\\"ubuntu\\\" {\\n  ami           = \\\"${var.ami_id}\\\"\\n  instance_type = \\\"${var.instance_type}\\\"\\n  availability_zone = \\\"${var.aws_region}a\\\"\\n\\n  tags {\\n    Name = \\\"${var.name}\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n\"\n}\n",

Operational Considerations\n\n### Monitoring and Logging Setup\n- Not detailed in the repository. AWS CloudWatch could be integrated for monitoring and logging.\n\n### Security Measures\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for managing sensitive credentials.\n- **IAM Roles and Policies:** Should be considered for securing access to AWS resources.\n\n### Scalability Provisions\n- **EC2 Instance Type and AMI:** Configurable through variables, allowing for scaling by changing instance types or counts.\n\n### Backup and Disaster Recovery\n- Not explicitly defined. AWS services like EBS snapshots or AMI backups could be utilized.\n\n## 7. Areas for Improvement\n\n### Technical Debt\n- **Documentation:** Enhance README with detailed setup and usage instructions.\n- **Environment Management:** Implement a strategy for managing multiple environments.\n\n### Security Considerations\n- **Secret Management:** Consider using AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault for managing sensitive information.\n- **IAM Policies:** Review and restrict permissions to the minimum necessary.\n\n### Scalability Concerns\n- **Auto-scaling:** Consider implementing AWS Auto Scaling for EC2 instances.\n\n### DevOps Pipeline Optimization\n- **CI/CD Integration:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.\n- **Testing:** Incorporate automated testing for Terraform configurations.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the repository can be enhanced to support more robust, secure, and scalable infrastructure deployments.\n\nFile Structure:\n{\"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate.backup\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/outputs.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/main.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/README.md\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/variables.tf\": \"file\"}\n\nRelevant Files:\n{\n  \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/main.tf\": \"terraform {\\n  required_version = \\\">= 0.11.0\\\"\\n}\\n\\nresource \\\"aws_instance\\\" \\\"dev_instance\\\" {\\n  ami           = var.ami_id\\n  instance_type = \\\"t2.micro\\\"\\n  tags = {\\n    Name = \\\"Development-Instance\\\"\\n  }\\n  # Using default security group and no key pair as specified\\n}\\n\\nprovider \\\"aws\\\" {\\n  region = \\\"${var.aws_region}\\\"\\n}\\n\\nresource \\\"aws_instance\\\" \\\"ubuntu\\\" {\\n  ami           = \\\"${var.ami_id}\\\"\\n  instance_type = \\\"${var.instance_type}\\\"\\n  availability_zone = \\\"${var.aws_region}a\\\"\\n\\n  tags = {\\n    Name = \\\"${var.name}\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n\"\n}\n",

  "codebase_context": "Overview:\n# Comprehensive Overview of the Mono Repository\n\n## 1. Overall Architecture\n\n### High-level System Design\nThe repository is structured to provision AWS infrastructure using Terraform, specifically focusing on deploying an EC2 instance. The design follows a modular approach, with separate files for defining variables, outputs, and the main configuration.\n\n### Design Patterns and Principles\n- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The repository employs IaC principles using Terraform, enabling version-controlled and repeatable infrastructure deployments.\n- **Separation of Concerns:** Different aspects of the configuration (variables, outputs, main configuration) are separated into distinct files, promoting clarity and maintainability.\n\n### System Boundaries and Interfaces\n- **Interfaces:** The primary interface is the Terraform CLI, which interacts with AWS APIs to provision resources.\n- **Boundaries:** The system boundary is defined by the AWS infrastructure components managed by Terraform, specifically the EC2 instance.\n\n## 2. Development Infrastructure\n\n### Technology Stack\n- **Terraform:** Used for defining and provisioning infrastructure.\n- **AWS:** The cloud provider where resources are deployed.\n\n### Key Dependencies\n- **Terraform CLI:** Required for executing the Terraform scripts.\n- **AWS Provider for Terraform:** Facilitates interaction with AWS services.\n\n### Development Tools and Requirements\n- **Terraform Version:** Specified in the `main.tf` file.\n- **AWS Credentials:** Managed through environment variables for authentication and authorization.\n\n## 3. DevOps Infrastructure\n\n### Deployment Architecture\n- **Infrastructure as Code Setup:** Utilizes Terraform scripts to define and automate the deployment of AWS resources.\n- **Configuration Management Approach:** Managed through Terraform's variable and output mechanisms.\n\n### Service Dependencies and Integration Points\n- **AWS Services:** The primary dependency is on AWS EC2, with potential for integration with other AWS services as needed.\n\n## 4. Environment Management\n\n### Development, Staging, and Production Environments\n- The repository currently does not explicitly define separate environments. However, Terraform's variable system allows for environment-specific configurations.\n\n### Environment-specific Configurations\n- **Variables:** Defined in `variables.tf`, allowing customization for different environments.\n\n### Environment Promotion Strategy\n- Not explicitly defined, but can be managed through Terraform workspaces or separate state files for different environments.\n\n### Configuration and Secret Management\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for managing AWS credentials, ensuring sensitive information is not hard-coded.\n\n## 5. CI/CD Pipeline\n\n### Build and Deployment Processes\n- The repository does not currently include a CI/CD pipeline setup. However, it can be integrated with tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.\n\n### Testing Strategies\n- **Terraform Plan:** Can be used to preview changes before applying them, serving as a basic form of testing.\n\n### Deployment Strategies\n- **Direct Deployment:** Current setup suggests direct deployment without advanced strategies like blue-green or canary.\n\n### Release Management\n- Not explicitly defined within the repository.\n\n## 6. Operational Considerations\n\n### Monitoring and Logging Setup\n- Not detailed in the repository. AWS CloudWatch could be integrated for monitoring and logging.\n\n### Security Measures\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for managing sensitive credentials.\n- **IAM Roles and Policies:** Should be considered for securing access to AWS resources.\n\n### Scalability Provisions\n- **EC2 Instance Type and AMI:** Configurable through variables, allowing for scaling by changing instance types or counts.\n\n### Backup and Disaster Recovery\n- Not explicitly defined. AWS services like EBS snapshots or AMI backups could be utilized.\n\n## 7. Areas for Improvement\n\n### Technical Debt\n- **Documentation:** Enhance README with detailed setup and usage instructions.\n- **Environment Management:** Implement a strategy for managing multiple environments.\n\n### Security Considerations\n- **Secret Management:** Consider using AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault for managing sensitive information.\n- **IAM Policies:** Review and restrict permissions to the minimum necessary.\n\n### Scalability Concerns\n- **Auto-scaling:** Consider implementing AWS Auto Scaling for EC2 instances.\n\n### DevOps Pipeline Optimization\n- **CI/CD Integration:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.\n- **Testing:** Incorporate automated testing for Terraform configurations.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the repository can be enhanced to support more robust, secure, and scalable infrastructure deployments.\n\nFile Structure:\n{\"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate.backup\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/outputs.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/main.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/README.md\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/variables.tf\": \"file\"}\n\nRelevant Files:\n{\n  \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/main.tf\": \"terraform {\\n  required_version = \\\">= 0.11.0\\\"\\n}\\n\\nresource \\\"aws_instance\\\" \\\"dev_instance\\\" {\\n  ami           = var.ami_id\\n  instance_type = \\\"t2.micro\\\"\\n  tags = {\\n    Name = \\\"Development-Instance\\\"\\n  }\\n  # Using default security group and no key pair as specified\\n}\\n\\nprovider \\\"aws\\\" {\\n  region = \\\"${var.aws_region}\\\"\\n}\\n\\nresource \\\"aws_instance\\\" \\\"ubuntu\\\" {\\n  ami           = \\\"${var.ami_id}\\\"\\n  instance_type = \\\"${var.instance_type}\\\"\\n  availability_zone = \\\"${var.aws_region}a\\\"\\n\\n  tags = {\\n    Name = \\\"${var.name}\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n\"\n}\n",

  "codebase_context": "Overview:\n# Comprehensive Overview of the Mono Repository\n\n## 1. Overall Architecture\n\n### High-level System Design\nThe repository is structured to provision AWS infrastructure using Terraform, specifically focusing on deploying an EC2 instance. The design follows a modular approach, with separate files for defining variables, outputs, and the main configuration.\n\n### Design Patterns and Principles\n- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The repository employs IaC principles using Terraform, enabling version-controlled and repeatable infrastructure deployments.\n- **Separation of Concerns:** Different aspects of the configuration (variables, outputs, main configuration) are separated into distinct files, promoting clarity and maintainability.\n\n### System Boundaries and Interfaces\n- **Interfaces:** The primary interface is the Terraform CLI, which interacts with AWS APIs to provision resources.\n- **Boundaries:** The system boundary is defined by the AWS infrastructure components managed by Terraform, specifically the EC2 instance.\n\n## 2. Development Infrastructure\n\n### Technology Stack\n- **Terraform:** Used for defining and provisioning infrastructure.\n- **AWS:** The cloud provider where resources are deployed.\n\n### Key Dependencies\n- **Terraform CLI:** Required for executing the Terraform scripts.\n- **AWS Provider for Terraform:** Facilitates interaction with AWS services.\n\n### Development Tools and Requirements\n- **Terraform Version:** Specified in the `main.tf` file.\n- **AWS Credentials:** Managed through environment variables for authentication and authorization.\n\n## 3. DevOps Infrastructure\n\n### Deployment Architecture\n- **Infrastructure as Code Setup:** Utilizes Terraform scripts to define and automate the deployment of AWS resources.\n- **Configuration Management Approach:** Managed through Terraform's variable and output mechanisms.\n\n### Service Dependencies and Integration Points\n- **AWS Services:** The primary dependency is on AWS EC2, with potential for integration with other AWS services as needed.\n\n## 4.

  "codebase_context": "Overview:\n# Comprehensive Overview of the Mono Repository\n\n## 1. Overall Architecture\n\n### High-level System Design\nThe repository is structured to provision AWS infrastructure using Terraform, specifically focusing on deploying an EC2 instance. The design follows a modular approach, with separate files for defining variables, outputs, and the main configuration.\n\n### Design Patterns and Principles\n- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The repository employs IaC principles using Terraform, enabling version-controlled and repeatable infrastructure deployments.\n- **Separation of Concerns:** Different aspects of the configuration (variables, outputs, main configuration) are separated into distinct files, promoting clarity and maintainability.\n\n### System Boundaries and Interfaces\n- **Interfaces:** The primary interface is the Terraform CLI, which interacts with AWS APIs to provision resources.\n- **Boundaries:** The system boundary is defined by the AWS infrastructure components managed by Terraform, specifically the EC2 instance.\n\n## 2. Development Infrastructure\n\n### Technology Stack\n- **Terraform:** Used for defining and provisioning infrastructure.\n- **AWS:** The cloud provider where resources are deployed.\n\n### Key Dependencies\n- **Terraform CLI:** Required for executing the Terraform scripts.\n- **AWS Provider for Terraform:** Facilitates interaction with AWS services.\n\n### Development Tools and Requirements\n- **Terraform Version:** Specified in the `main.tf` file.\n- **AWS Credentials:** Managed through environment variables for authentication and authorization.\n\n## 3. DevOps Infrastructure\n\n### Deployment Architecture\n- **Infrastructure as Code Setup:** Utilizes Terraform scripts to define and automate the deployment of AWS resources.\n- **Configuration Management Approach:** Managed through Terraform's variable and output mechanisms.\n\n### Service Dependencies and Integration Points\n- **AWS Services:** The primary dependency is on AWS EC2, with potential for integration with other AWS services as needed.\n\n## 4. Environment Management\n\n### Development, Staging, and Production Environments\n- The repository currently does not explicitly define separate environments. However, Terraform's variable system allows for environment-specific configurations.\n\n### Environment-specific Configurations\n- **Variables:** Defined in `variables.tf`, allowing customization for different environments.\n\n### Environment Promotion Strategy\n- Not explicitly defined, but can be managed through Terraform workspaces or separate state files for different environments.\n\n### Configuration and Secret Management\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for managing AWS credentials, ensuring sensitive information is not hard-coded.\n\n## 5. CI/CD Pipeline\n\n### Build and Deployment Processes\n- The repository does not currently include a CI/CD pipeline setup. However, it can be integrated with tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.\n\n### Testing Strategies\n- **Terraform Plan:** Can be used to preview changes before applying them, serving as a basic form of testing.\n\n### Deployment Strategies\n- **Direct Deployment:** Current setup suggests direct deployment without advanced strategies like blue-green or canary.\n\n### Release Management\n- Not explicitly defined within the repository.\n\n## 6. Operational Considerations\n\n### Monitoring and Logging Setup\n- Not detailed in the repository. AWS CloudWatch could be integrated for monitoring and logging.\n\n### Security Measures\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for managing sensitive credentials.\n- **IAM Roles and Policies:** Should be considered for securing access to AWS resources.\n\n### Scalability Provisions\n- **EC2 Instance Type and AMI:** Configurable through variables, allowing for scaling by changing instance types or counts.\n\n### Backup and Disaster Recovery\n- Not explicitly defined. AWS services like EBS snapshots or AMI backups could be utilized.\n\n## 7. Areas for Improvement\n\n### Technical Debt\n- **Documentation:** Enhance README with detailed setup and usage instructions.\n- **Environment Management:** Implement a strategy for managing multiple environments.\n\n### Security Considerations\n- **Secret Management:** Consider using AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault for managing sensitive information.\n- **IAM Policies:** Review and restrict permissions to the minimum necessary.\n\n### Scalability Concerns\n- **Auto-scaling:** Consider implementing AWS Auto Scaling for EC2 instances.\n\n### DevOps Pipeline Optimization\n- **CI/CD Integration:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.\n- **Testing:** Incorporate automated testing for Terraform configurations.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the repository can be enhanced to support more robust, secure, and scalable infrastructure deployments.\n\nFile Structure:\n{\"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate.backup\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/outputs.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/main.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/README.md\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/variables.tf\": \"file\"}\n\nRelevant Files:\n{\n  \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/main.tf\": \"terraform {\\n  required_version = \\\">= 0.11.0\\\"\\n}\\n\\nresource \\\"aws_instance\\\" \\\"dev_instance\\\" {\\n  ami           = var.ami_id\\n  instance_type = \\\"t2.micro\\\"\\n  tags = {\\n    Name = \\\"Development-Instance\\\"\\n  }\\n  # Using default security group and no key pair as specified\\n}\\n\\nprovider \\\"aws\\\" {\\n  region = \\\"${var.aws_region}\\\"\\n}\\n\\nresource \\\"aws_instance\\\" \\\"ubuntu\\\" {\\n  ami           = \\\"${var.ami_id}\\\"\\n  instance_type = \\\"${var.instance_type}\\\"\\n  availability_zone = \\\"${var.aws_region}b\\\"\\n\\n  tags = {\\n    Name = \\\"${var.name}\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n\"\n}\n",

DevOps Infrastructure\n\n### Deployment Architecture\n- **Infrastructure as Code Setup:** Utilizes Terraform scripts to define and automate the deployment of AWS resources.\n- **Configuration Management Approach:** Managed through Terraform's variable and output mechanisms.\n\n### Service Dependencies and Integration Points\n- **AWS Services:** The primary dependency is on AWS EC2, with potential for integration with other AWS services as needed.\n\n## 4. Environment Management\n\n### Development, Staging, and Production Environments\n- The repository currently does not explicitly define separate environments. However, Terraform's variable system allows for environment-specific configurations.\n\n### Environment-specific Configurations\n- **Variables:** Defined in `variables.tf`, allowing customization for different environments.\n\n### Environment Promotion Strategy\n- Not explicitly defined, but can be managed through Terraform workspaces or separate state files for different environments.\n\n### Configuration and Secret Management\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for managing AWS credentials, ensuring sensitive information is not hard-coded.\n\n## 5. CI/CD Pipeline\n\n### Build and Deployment Processes\n- The repository does not currently include a CI/CD pipeline setup. However, it can be integrated with tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.\n\n### Testing Strategies\n- **Terraform Plan:** Can be used to preview changes before applying them, serving as a basic form of testing.\n\n### Deployment Strategies\n- **Direct Deployment:** Current setup suggests direct deployment without advanced strategies like blue-green or canary.\n\n### Release Management\n- Not explicitly defined within the repository.\n\n## 6. Operational Considerations\n\n### Monitoring and Logging Setup\n- Not detailed in the repository. AWS CloudWatch could be integrated for monitoring and logging.\n\n### Security Measures\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for managing sensitive credentials.\n- **IAM Roles and Policies:** Should be considered for securing access to AWS resources.\n\n### Scalability Provisions\n- **EC2 Instance Type and AMI:** Configurable through variables, allowing for scaling by changing instance types or counts.\n\n### Backup and Disaster Recovery\n- Not explicitly defined. AWS services like EBS snapshots or AMI backups could be utilized.\n\n## 7. Areas for Improvement\n\n### Technical Debt\n- **Documentation:** Enhance README with detailed setup and usage instructions.\n- **Environment Management:** Implement a strategy for managing multiple environments.\n\n### Security Considerations\n- **Secret Management:** Consider using AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault for managing sensitive information.\n- **IAM Policies:** Review and restrict permissions to the minimum necessary.\n\n### Scalability Concerns\n- **Auto-scaling:** Consider implementing AWS Auto Scaling for EC2 instances.\n\n### DevOps Pipeline Optimization\n- **CI/CD Integration:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.\n- **Testing:** Incorporate automated testing for Terraform configurations.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the repository can be enhanced to support more robust, secure, and scalable infrastructure deployments.\n\nFile Structure:\n{\"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate.backup\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/outputs.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/main.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/README.md\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/variables.tf\": \"file\"}\n\nRelevant Files:\nNo file contents available\n",

  "codebase_context": "Overview:\n# Comprehensive Overview of the Mono Repository\n\n## 1. Overall Architecture\n\n### High-level System Design\nThe repository is structured to provision AWS infrastructure using Terraform, specifically focusing on deploying an EC2 instance. The design follows a modular approach, with separate files for defining variables, outputs, and the main configuration.\n\n### Design Patterns and Principles\n- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The repository employs IaC principles using Terraform, enabling version-controlled and repeatable infrastructure deployments.\n- **Separation of Concerns:** Different aspects of the configuration (variables, outputs, main configuration) are separated into distinct files, promoting clarity and maintainability.\n\n### System Boundaries and Interfaces\n- **Interfaces:** The primary interface is the Terraform CLI, which interacts with AWS APIs to provision resources.\n- **Boundaries:** The system boundary is defined by the AWS infrastructure components managed by Terraform, specifically the EC2 instance.\n\n## 2. Development Infrastructure\n\n### Technology Stack\n- **Terraform:** Used for defining and provisioning infrastructure.\n- **AWS:** The cloud provider where resources are deployed.\n\n### Key Dependencies\n- **Terraform CLI:** Required for executing the Terraform scripts.\n- **AWS Provider for Terraform:** Facilitates interaction with AWS services.\n\n### Development Tools and Requirements\n- **Terraform Version:** Specified in the `main.tf` file.\n- **AWS Credentials:** Managed through environment variables for authentication and authorization.\n\n## 3. DevOps Infrastructure\n\n### Deployment Architecture\n- **Infrastructure as Code Setup:** Utilizes Terraform scripts to define and automate the deployment of AWS resources.\n- **Configuration Management Approach:** Managed through Terraform's variable and output mechanisms.\n\n### Service Dependencies and Integration Points\n- **AWS Services:** The primary dependency is on AWS EC2, with potential for integration with other AWS services as needed.\n\n## 4. Environment Management\n\n### Development, Staging, and Production Environments\n- The repository currently does not explicitly define separate environments. However, Terraform's variable system allows for environment-specific configurations.\n\n### Environment-specific Configurations\n- **Variables:** Defined in `variables.tf`, allowing customization for different environments.\n\n### Environment Promotion Strategy\n- Not explicitly defined, but can be managed through Terraform workspaces or separate state files for different environments.\n\n### Configuration and Secret Management\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for managing AWS credentials, ensuring sensitive information is not hard-coded.\n\n## 5. CI/CD Pipeline\n\n### Build and Deployment Processes\n- The repository does not currently include a CI/CD pipeline setup. However, it can be integrated with tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.\n\n### Testing Strategies\n- **Terraform Plan:** Can be used to preview changes before applying them, serving as a basic form of testing.\n\n### Deployment Strategies\n- **Direct Deployment:** Current setup suggests direct deployment without advanced strategies like blue-green or canary.\n\n### Release Management\n- Not explicitly defined within the repository.\n\n## 6. Operational Considerations\n\n### Monitoring and Logging Setup\n- Not detailed in the repository. AWS CloudWatch could be integrated for monitoring and logging.\n\n### Security Measures\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for managing sensitive credentials.\n- **IAM Roles and Policies:** Should be considered for securing access to AWS resources.\n\n### Scalability Provisions\n- **EC2 Instance Type and AMI:** Configurable through variables, allowing for scaling by changing instance types or counts.\n\n### Backup and Disaster Recovery\n- Not explicitly defined. AWS services like EBS snapshots or AMI backups could be utilized.\n\n## 7. Areas for Improvement\n\n### Technical Debt\n- **Documentation:** Enhance README with detailed setup and usage instructions.\n- **Environment Management:** Implement a strategy for managing multiple environments.\n\n### Security Considerations\n- **Secret Management:** Consider using AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault for managing sensitive information.\n- **IAM Policies:** Review and restrict permissions to the minimum necessary.\n\n### Scalability Concerns\n- **Auto-scaling:** Consider implementing AWS Auto Scaling for EC2 instances.\n\n### DevOps Pipeline Optimization\n- **CI/CD Integration:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.\n- **Testing:** Incorporate automated testing for Terraform configurations.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the repository can be enhanced to support more robust, secure, and scalable infrastructure deployments.\n\nFile Structure:\n{\"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate.backup\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/outputs.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/main.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/README.md\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/variables.tf\": \"file\"}\n\nRelevant Files:\nNo file contents available\n",

  "codebase_context": "Overview:\n# Comprehensive Overview of the Mono Repository\n\n## 1. Overall Architecture\n\n### High-level System Design\nThe repository is structured to provision AWS infrastructure using Terraform, specifically focusing on deploying an EC2 instance. The design follows a modular approach, with separate files for defining variables, outputs, and the main configuration.\n\n### Design Patterns and Principles\n- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The repository employs IaC principles using Terraform, enabling version-controlled and repeatable infrastructure deployments.\n- **Separation of Concerns:** Different aspects of the configuration (variables, outputs, main configuration) are separated into distinct files, promoting clarity and maintainability.\n\n### System Boundaries and Interfaces\n- **Interfaces:** The primary interface is the Terraform CLI, which interacts with AWS APIs to provision resources.\n- **Boundaries:** The system boundary is defined by the AWS infrastructure components managed by Terraform, specifically the EC2 instance.\n\n## 2. Development Infrastructure\n\n### Technology Stack\n- **Terraform:** Used for defining and provisioning infrastructure.\n- **AWS:** The cloud provider where resources are deployed.\n\n### Key Dependencies\n- **Terraform CLI:** Required for executing the Terraform scripts.\n- **AWS Provider for Terraform:** Facilitates interaction with AWS services.\n\n### Development Tools and Requirements\n- **Terraform Version:** Specified in the `main.tf` file.\n- **AWS Credentials:** Managed through environment variables for authentication and authorization.\n\n## 3. DevOps Infrastructure\n\n### Deployment Architecture\n- **Infrastructure as Code Setup:** Utilizes Terraform scripts to define and automate the deployment of AWS resources.\n- **Configuration Management Approach:** Managed through Terraform's variable and output mechanisms.\n\n### Service Dependencies and Integration Points\n- **AWS Services:** The primary dependency is on AWS EC2, with potential for integration with other AWS services as needed.\n\n## 4. Environment Management\n\n### Development, Staging, and Production Environments\n- The repository currently does not explicitly define separate environments. However, Terraform's variable system allows for environment-specific configurations.\n\n### Environment-specific Configurations\n- **Variables:** Defined in `variables.tf`, allowing customization for different environments.\n\n### Environment Promotion Strategy\n- Not explicitly defined, but can be managed through Terraform workspaces or separate state files for different environments.\n\n### Configuration and Secret Management\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for managing AWS credentials, ensuring sensitive information is not hard-coded.\n\n## 5. CI/CD Pipeline\n\n### Build and Deployment Processes\n- The repository does not currently include a CI/CD pipeline setup. However, it can be integrated with tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.\n\n### Testing Strategies\n- **Terraform Plan:** Can be used to preview changes before applying them, serving as a basic form of testing.\n\n### Deployment Strategies\n- **Direct Deployment:** Current setup suggests direct deployment without advanced strategies like blue-green or canary.\n\n### Release Management\n- Not explicitly defined within the repository.\n\n## 6. Operational Considerations\n\n### Monitoring and Logging Setup\n- Not detailed in the repository. AWS CloudWatch could be integrated for monitoring and logging.\n\n### Security Measures\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for managing sensitive credentials.\n- **IAM Roles and Policies:** Should be considered for securing access to AWS resources.\n\n### Scalability Provisions\n- **EC2 Instance Type and AMI:** Configurable through variables, allowing for scaling by changing instance types or counts.\n\n### Backup and Disaster Recovery\n- Not explicitly defined. AWS services like EBS snapshots or AMI backups could be utilized.\n\n## 7. Areas for Improvement\n\n### Technical Debt\n- **Documentation:** Enhance README with detailed setup and usage instructions.\n- **Environment Management:** Implement a strategy for managing multiple environments.\n\n### Security Considerations\n- **Secret Management:** Consider using AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault for managing sensitive information.\n- **IAM Policies:** Review and restrict permissions to the minimum necessary.\n\n### Scalability Concerns\n- **Auto-scaling:** Consider implementing AWS Auto Scaling for EC2 instances.\n\n### DevOps Pipeline Optimization\n- **CI/CD Integration:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.\n- **Testing:** Incorporate automated testing for Terraform configurations.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the repository can be enhanced to support more robust, secure, and scalable infrastructure deployments.\n\nFile Structure:\n{\"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate.backup\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/outputs.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/main.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/README.md\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/variables.tf\": \"file\"}\n\nRelevant Files:\nNo file contents available\n",

  "codebase_context": "Overview:\n# Comprehensive Overview of the Mono Repository\n\n## 1. Overall Architecture\n\n### High-level System Design\nThe repository is structured to provision AWS infrastructure using Terraform, specifically focusing on deploying an EC2 instance. The design follows a modular approach, with separate files for defining variables, outputs, and the main configuration.\n\n### Design Patterns and Principles\n- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The repository employs IaC principles using Terraform, enabling version-controlled and repeatable infrastructure deployments.\n- **Separation of Concerns:** Different aspects of the configuration (variables, outputs, main configuration) are separated into distinct files, promoting clarity and maintainability.\n\n### System Boundaries and Interfaces\n- **Interfaces:** The primary interface is the Terraform CLI, which interacts with AWS APIs to provision resources.\n- **Boundaries:** The system boundary is defined by the AWS infrastructure components managed by Terraform, specifically the EC2 instance.\n\n## 2. Development Infrastructure\n\n### Technology Stack\n- **Terraform:** Used for defining and provisioning infrastructure.\n- **AWS:** The cloud provider where resources are deployed.\n\n### Key Dependencies\n- **Terraform CLI:** Required for executing the Terraform scripts.\n- **AWS Provider for Terraform:** Facilitates interaction with AWS services.\n\n### Development Tools and Requirements\n- **Terraform Version:** Specified in the `main.tf` file.\n- **AWS Credentials:** Managed through environment variables for authentication and authorization.\n\n## 3. DevOps Infrastructure\n\n### Deployment Architecture\n- **Infrastructure as Code Setup:** Utilizes Terraform scripts to define and automate the deployment of AWS resources.\n- **Configuration Management Approach:** Managed through Terraform's variable and output mechanisms.\n\n### Service Dependencies and Integration Points\n- **AWS Services:** The primary dependency is on AWS EC2, with potential for integration with other AWS services as needed.\n\n## 4. Environment Management\n\n### Development, Staging, and Production Environments\n- The repository currently does not explicitly define separate environments. However, Terraform's variable system allows for environment-specific configurations.\n\n### Environment-specific Configurations\n- **Variables:** Defined in `variables.tf`, allowing customization for different environments.\n\n### Environment Promotion Strategy\n- Not explicitly defined, but can be managed through Terraform workspaces or separate state files for different environments.\n\n### Configuration and Secret Management\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for managing AWS credentials, ensuring sensitive information is not hard-coded.\n\n## 5. CI/CD Pipeline\n\n### Build and Deployment Processes\n- The repository does not currently include a CI/CD pipeline setup. However, it can be integrated with tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.\n\n### Testing Strategies\n- **Terraform Plan:** Can be used to preview changes before applying them, serving as a basic form of testing.\n\n### Deployment Strategies\n- **Direct Deployment:** Current setup suggests direct deployment without advanced strategies like blue-green or canary.\n\n### Release Management\n- Not explicitly defined within the repository.\n\n## 6. Operational Considerations\n\n### Monitoring and Logging Setup\n- Not detailed in the repository. AWS CloudWatch could be integrated for monitoring and logging.\n\n### Security Measures\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for managing sensitive credentials.\n- **IAM Roles and Policies:** Should be considered for securing access to AWS resources.\n\n### Scalability Provisions\n- **EC2 Instance Type and AMI:** Configurable through variables, allowing for scaling by changing instance types or counts.\n\n### Backup and Disaster Recovery\n- Not explicitly defined. AWS services like EBS snapshots or AMI backups could be utilized.\n\n## 7. Areas for Improvement\n\n### Technical Debt\n- **Documentation:** Enhance README with detailed setup and usage instructions.\n- **Environment Management:** Implement a strategy for managing multiple environments.\n\n### Security Considerations\n- **Secret Management:** Consider using AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault for managing sensitive information.\n- **IAM Policies:** Review and restrict permissions to the minimum necessary.\n\n### Scalability Concerns\n- **Auto-scaling:** Consider implementing AWS Auto Scaling for EC2 instances.\n\n### DevOps Pipeline Optimization\n- **CI/CD Integration:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.\n- **Testing:** Incorporate automated testing for Terraform configurations.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the repository can be enhanced to support more robust, secure, and scalable infrastructure deployments.\n\nFile Structure:\n{\"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate.backup\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/outputs.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/main.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/README.md\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/variables.tf\": \"file\"}\n\nRelevant Files:\nNo file contents available\n",

Create the 'dev.tfvars' file with the correct content.

content:
{"file_path": "dev.tfvars", "content": "ami_id = \"ami-12345678\"\ninstance_type = \"t2.micro\"\nregion = \"us-west-2\""}

reasoning:
The previous attempts to create the 'dev.tfvars' file seem to have incorrect file path formatting. I will create the 'dev.tfvars' file with the correct path and content to ensure Terraform can read it properly.

  "codebase_context": "Overview:\n# Comprehensive Overview of the Mono Repository\n\n## 1. Overall Architecture\n\n### High-level System Design\nThe repository is structured to provision AWS infrastructure using Terraform, specifically focusing on deploying an EC2 instance. The design follows a modular approach, with separate files for defining variables, outputs, and the main configuration.\n\n### Design Patterns and Principles\n- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The repository employs IaC principles using Terraform, enabling version-controlled and repeatable infrastructure deployments.\n- **Separation of Concerns:** Different aspects of the configuration (variables, outputs, main configuration) are separated into distinct files, promoting clarity and maintainability.\n\n### System Boundaries and Interfaces\n- **Interfaces:** The primary interface is the Terraform CLI, which interacts with AWS APIs to provision resources.\n- **Boundaries:** The system boundary is defined by the AWS infrastructure components managed by Terraform, specifically the EC2 instance.\n\n## 2. Development Infrastructure\n\n### Technology Stack\n- **Terraform:** Used for defining and provisioning infrastructure.\n- **AWS:** The cloud provider where resources are deployed.\n\n### Key Dependencies\n- **Terraform CLI:** Required for executing the Terraform scripts.\n- **AWS Provider for Terraform:** Facilitates interaction with AWS services.\n\n### Development Tools and Requirements\n- **Terraform Version:** Specified in the `main.tf` file.\n- **AWS Credentials:** Managed through environment variables for authentication and authorization.\n\n## 3. DevOps Infrastructure\n\n### Deployment Architecture\n- **Infrastructure as Code Setup:** Utilizes Terraform scripts to define and automate the deployment of AWS resources.\n- **Configuration Management Approach:** Managed through Terraform's variable and output mechanisms.\n\n### Service Dependencies and Integration Points\n- **AWS Services:** The primary dependency is on AWS EC2, with potential for integration with other AWS services as needed.\n\n## 4. Environment Management\n\n### Development, Staging, and Production Environments\n- The repository currently does not explicitly define separate environments. However, Terraform's variable system allows for environment-specific configurations.\n\n### Environment-specific Configurations\n- **Variables:** Defined in `variables.tf`, allowing customization for different environments.\n\n### Environment Promotion Strategy\n- Not explicitly defined, but can be managed through Terraform workspaces or separate state files for different environments.\n\n### Configuration and Secret Management\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for managing AWS credentials, ensuring sensitive information is not hard-coded.\n\n## 5. CI/CD Pipeline\n\n### Build and Deployment Processes\n- The repository does not currently include a CI/CD pipeline setup. However, it can be integrated with tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.\n\n### Testing Strategies\n- **Terraform Plan:** Can be used to preview changes before applying them, serving as a basic form of testing.\n\n### Deployment Strategies\n- **Direct Deployment:** Current setup suggests direct deployment without advanced strategies like blue-green or canary.\n\n### Release Management\n- Not explicitly defined within the repository.\n\n## 6. Operational Considerations\n\n### Monitoring and Logging Setup\n- Not detailed in the repository. AWS CloudWatch could be integrated for monitoring and logging.\n\n### Security Measures\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for managing sensitive credentials.\n- **IAM Roles and Policies:** Should be considered for securing access to AWS resources.\n\n### Scalability Provisions\n- **EC2 Instance Type and AMI:** Configurable through variables, allowing for scaling by changing instance types or counts.\n\n### Backup and Disaster Recovery\n- Not explicitly defined. AWS services like EBS snapshots or AMI backups could be utilized.\n\n## 7. Areas for Improvement\n\n### Technical Debt\n- **Documentation:** Enhance README with detailed setup and usage instructions.\n- **Environment Management:** Implement a strategy for managing multiple environments.\n\n### Security Considerations\n- **Secret Management:** Consider using AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault for managing sensitive information.\n- **IAM Policies:** Review and restrict permissions to the minimum necessary.\n\n### Scalability Concerns\n- **Auto-scaling:** Consider implementing AWS Auto Scaling for EC2 instances.\n\n### DevOps Pipeline Optimization\n- **CI/CD Integration:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.\n- **Testing:** Incorporate automated testing for Terraform configurations.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the repository can be enhanced to support more robust, secure, and scalable infrastructure deployments.\n\nFile Structure:\n{\"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate.backup\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/outputs.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/main.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/README.md\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/variables.tf\": \"file\"}\n\nRelevant Files:\nNo file contents available\n",

The design follows a modular approach, with separate files for defining variables, outputs, and the main configuration.\n\n### Design Patterns and Principles\n- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The repository employs IaC principles using Terraform, enabling version-controlled and repeatable infrastructure deployments.\n- **Separation of Concerns:** Different aspects of the configuration (variables, outputs, main configuration) are separated into distinct files, promoting clarity and maintainability.\n\n### System Boundaries and Interfaces\n- **Interfaces:** The primary interface is the Terraform CLI, which interacts with AWS APIs to provision resources.\n- **Boundaries:** The system boundary is defined by the AWS infrastructure components managed by Terraform, specifically the EC2 instance.\n\n## 2. Development Infrastructure\n\n### Technology Stack\n- **Terraform:** Used for defining and provisioning infrastructure.\n- **AWS:** The cloud provider where resources are deployed.\n\n### Key Dependencies\n- **Terraform CLI:** Required for executing the Terraform scripts.\n- **AWS Provider for Terraform:** Facilitates interaction with AWS services.\n\n### Development Tools and Requirements\n- **Terraform Version:** Specified in the `main.tf` file.\n- **AWS Credentials:** Managed through environment variables for authentication and authorization.\n\n## 3. DevOps Infrastructure\n\n### Deployment Architecture\n- **Infrastructure as Code Setup:** Utilizes Terraform scripts to define and automate the deployment of AWS resources.\n- **Configuration Management Approach:** Managed through Terraform's variable and output mechanisms.\n\n### Service Dependencies and Integration Points\n- **AWS Services:** The primary dependency is on AWS EC2, with potential for integration with other AWS services as needed.\n\n## 4. Environment Management\n\n### Development, Staging, and Production Environments\n- The repository currently does not explicitly define separate environments. However, Terraform's variable system allows for environment-specific configurations.\n\n### Environment-specific Configurations\n- **Variables:** Defined in `variables.tf`, allowing customization for different environments.\n\n### Environment Promotion Strategy\n- Not explicitly defined, but can be managed through Terraform workspaces or separate state files for different environments.\n\n### Configuration and Secret Management\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for managing AWS credentials, ensuring sensitive information is not hard-coded.\n\n## 5. CI/CD Pipeline\n\n### Build and Deployment Processes\n- The repository does not currently include a CI/CD pipeline setup. However, it can be integrated with tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.\n\n### Testing Strategies\n- **Terraform Plan:** Can be used to preview changes before applying them, serving as a basic form of testing.\n\n### Deployment Strategies\n- **Direct Deployment:** Current setup suggests direct deployment without advanced strategies like blue-green or canary.\n\n### Release Management\n- Not explicitly defined within the repository.\n\n## 6. Operational Considerations\n\n### Monitoring and Logging Setup\n- Not detailed in the repository. AWS CloudWatch could be integrated for monitoring and logging.\n\n### Security Measures\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for managing sensitive credentials.\n- **IAM Roles and Policies:** Should be considered for securing access to AWS resources.\n\n### Scalability Provisions\n- **EC2 Instance Type and AMI:** Configurable through variables, allowing for scaling by changing instance types or counts.\n\n### Backup and Disaster Recovery\n- Not explicitly defined. AWS services like EBS snapshots or AMI backups could be utilized.\n\n## 7. Areas for Improvement\n\n### Technical Debt\n- **Documentation:** Enhance README with detailed setup and usage instructions.\n- **Environment Management:** Implement a strategy for managing multiple environments.\n\n### Security Considerations\n- **Secret Management:** Consider using AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault for managing sensitive information.\n- **IAM Policies:** Review and restrict permissions to the minimum necessary.\n\n### Scalability Concerns\n- **Auto-scaling:** Consider implementing AWS Auto Scaling for EC2 instances.\n\n### DevOps Pipeline Optimization\n- **CI/CD Integration:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.\n- **Testing:** Incorporate automated testing for Terraform configurations.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the repository can be enhanced to support more robust, secure, and scalable infrastructure deployments.\n\nFile Structure:\n{\"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate.backup\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/outputs.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/main.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/README.md\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/variables.tf\": \"file\"}\n\nRelevant Files:\nNo file contents available\n",

  "codebase_context": "Overview:\n# Comprehensive Overview of the Mono Repository\n\n## 1. Overall Architecture\n\n### High-level System Design\nThe repository is structured to provision AWS infrastructure using Terraform, specifically focusing on deploying an EC2 instance. The design follows a modular approach, with separate files for defining variables, outputs, and the main configuration.\n\n### Design Patterns and Principles\n- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The repository employs IaC principles using Terraform, enabling version-controlled and repeatable infrastructure deployments.\n- **Separation of Concerns:** Different aspects of the configuration (variables, outputs, main configuration) are separated into distinct files, promoting clarity and maintainability.\n\n### System Boundaries and Interfaces\n- **Interfaces:** The primary interface is the Terraform CLI, which interacts with AWS APIs to provision resources.\n- **Boundaries:** The system boundary is defined by the AWS infrastructure components managed by Terraform, specifically the EC2 instance.\n\n## 2. Development Infrastructure\n\n### Technology Stack\n- **Terraform:** Used for defining and provisioning infrastructure.\n- **AWS:** The cloud provider where resources are deployed.\n\n### Key Dependencies\n- **Terraform CLI:** Required for executing the Terraform scripts.\n- **AWS Provider for Terraform:** Facilitates interaction with AWS services.\n\n### Development Tools and Requirements\n- **Terraform Version:** Specified in the `main.tf` file.\n- **AWS Credentials:** Managed through environment variables for authentication and authorization.\n\n## 3. DevOps Infrastructure\n\n### Deployment Architecture\n- **Infrastructure as Code Setup:** Utilizes Terraform scripts to define and automate the deployment of AWS resources.\n- **Configuration Management Approach:** Managed through Terraform's variable and output mechanisms.\n\n### Service Dependencies and Integration Points\n- **AWS Services:** The primary dependency is on AWS EC2, with potential for integration with other AWS services as needed.\n\n## 4. Environment Management\n\n### Development, Staging, and Production Environments\n- The repository currently does not explicitly define separate environments. However, Terraform's variable system allows for environment-specific configurations.\n\n### Environment-specific Configurations\n- **Variables:** Defined in `variables.tf`, allowing customization for different environments.\n\n### Environment Promotion Strategy\n- Not explicitly defined, but can be managed through Terraform workspaces or separate state files for different environments.\n\n### Configuration and Secret Management\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for managing AWS credentials, ensuring sensitive information is not hard-coded.\n\n## 5. CI/CD Pipeline\n\n### Build and Deployment Processes\n- The repository does not currently include a CI/CD pipeline setup. However, it can be integrated with tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.\n\n### Testing Strategies\n- **Terraform Plan:** Can be used to preview changes before applying them, serving as a basic form of testing.\n\n### Deployment Strategies\n- **Direct Deployment:** Current setup suggests direct deployment without advanced strategies like blue-green or canary.\n\n### Release Management\n- Not explicitly defined within the repository.\n\n## 6. Operational Considerations\n\n### Monitoring and Logging Setup\n- Not detailed in the repository. AWS CloudWatch could be integrated for monitoring and logging.\n\n### Security Measures\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for managing sensitive credentials.\n- **IAM Roles and Policies:** Should be considered for securing access to AWS resources.\n\n### Scalability Provisions\n- **EC2 Instance Type and AMI:** Configurable through variables, allowing for scaling by changing instance types or counts.\n\n### Backup and Disaster Recovery\n- Not explicitly defined. AWS services like EBS snapshots or AMI backups could be utilized.\n\n## 7. Areas for Improvement\n\n### Technical Debt\n- **Documentation:** Enhance README with detailed setup and usage instructions.\n- **Environment Management:** Implement a strategy for managing multiple environments.\n\n### Security Considerations\n- **Secret Management:** Consider using AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault for managing sensitive information.\n- **IAM Policies:** Review and restrict permissions to the minimum necessary.\n\n### Scalability Concerns\n- **Auto-scaling:** Consider implementing AWS Auto Scaling for EC2 instances.\n\n### DevOps Pipeline Optimization\n- **CI/CD Integration:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.\n- **Testing:** Incorporate automated testing for Terraform configurations.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the repository can be enhanced to support more robust, secure, and scalable infrastructure deployments.\n\nFile Structure:\n{\"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate.backup\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/outputs.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/main.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/README.md\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/variables.tf\": \"file\"}\n\nRelevant Files:\nNo file contents available\n",

Development Infrastructure\n\n### Technology Stack\n- **Terraform:** Used for defining and provisioning infrastructure.\n- **AWS:** The cloud provider where resources are deployed.\n\n### Key Dependencies\n- **Terraform CLI:** Required for executing the Terraform scripts.\n- **AWS Provider for Terraform:** Facilitates interaction with AWS services.\n\n### Development Tools and Requirements\n- **Terraform Version:** Specified in the `main.tf` file.\n- **AWS Credentials:** Managed through environment variables for authentication and authorization.\n\n## 3. DevOps Infrastructure\n\n### Deployment Architecture\n- **Infrastructure as Code Setup:** Utilizes Terraform scripts to define and automate the deployment of AWS resources.\n- **Configuration Management Approach:** Managed through Terraform's variable and output mechanisms.\n\n### Service Dependencies and Integration Points\n- **AWS Services:** The primary dependency is on AWS EC2, with potential for integration with other AWS services as needed.\n\n## 4. Environment Management\n\n### Development, Staging, and Production Environments\n- The repository currently does not explicitly define separate environments. However, Terraform's variable system allows for environment-specific configurations.\n\n### Environment-specific Configurations\n- **Variables:** Defined in `variables.tf`, allowing customization for different environments.\n\n### Environment Promotion Strategy\n- Not explicitly defined, but can be managed through Terraform workspaces or separate state files for different environments.\n\n### Configuration and Secret Management\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for managing AWS credentials, ensuring sensitive information is not hard-coded.\n\n## 5. CI/CD Pipeline\n\n### Build and Deployment Processes\n- The repository does not currently include a CI/CD pipeline setup. However, it can be integrated with tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.\n\n### Testing Strategies\n- **Terraform Plan:** Can be used to preview changes before applying them, serving as a basic form of testing.\n\n### Deployment Strategies\n- **Direct Deployment:** Current setup suggests direct deployment without advanced strategies like blue-green or canary.\n\n### Release Management\n- Not explicitly defined within the repository.\n\n## 6. Operational Considerations\n\n### Monitoring and Logging Setup\n- Not detailed in the repository. AWS CloudWatch could be integrated for monitoring and logging.\n\n### Security Measures\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for managing sensitive credentials.\n- **IAM Roles and Policies:** Should be considered for securing access to AWS resources.\n\n### Scalability Provisions\n- **EC2 Instance Type and AMI:** Configurable through variables, allowing for scaling by changing instance types or counts.\n\n### Backup and Disaster Recovery\n- Not explicitly defined. AWS services like EBS snapshots or AMI backups could be utilized.\n\n## 7. Areas for Improvement\n\n### Technical Debt\n- **Documentation:** Enhance README with detailed setup and usage instructions.\n- **Environment Management:** Implement a strategy for managing multiple environments.\n\n### Security Considerations\n- **Secret Management:** Consider using AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault for managing sensitive information.\n- **IAM Policies:** Review and restrict permissions to the minimum necessary.\n\n### Scalability Concerns\n- **Auto-scaling:** Consider implementing AWS Auto Scaling for EC2 instances.\n\n### DevOps Pipeline Optimization\n- **CI/CD Integration:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.\n- **Testing:** Incorporate automated testing for Terraform configurations.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the repository can be enhanced to support more robust, secure, and scalable infrastructure deployments.\n\nFile Structure:\n{\"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate.backup\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/outputs.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/main.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/README.md\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/variables.tf\": \"file\"}\n\nRelevant Files:\nNo file contents available\n",
