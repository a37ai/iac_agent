Timestamp: 2025-01-26T16:30:42.148335
Tagline: Initialize Terraform to fix dependencies
Summary: Running 'terraform init' will initialize the Terraform working directory, addressing the inconsistency in the dependency lock file. This ensures all required providers are configured correctly for successful execution.

Timestamp: 2025-01-26T16:31:01.748996
Tagline: Validating Terraform configuration for accuracy
Summary: Running 'terraform plan' helps verify the correctness of the current Terraform setup after initialization. This step is crucial to preview infrastructure changes and ensure alignment with desired configurations.

Timestamp: 2025-01-26T16:31:18.833666
Tagline: Correcting AWS Instance Tags Syntax
Summary: The 'tags' block in the 'aws_instance' resources is incorrectly formatted and needs to be changed to use an equals sign. This correction is necessary to ensure the Terraform plan executes without errors.

Timestamp: 2025-01-26T16:31:25.699953
Tagline: Validating Terraform configuration changes
Summary: The 'tags' block in the Terraform configuration was corrected for syntax errors. Running 'terraform plan' will verify the configuration's validity and display any proposed infrastructure changes.

Timestamp: 2025-01-26T16:31:32.145959
Tagline: Provisioning IAM Role for EC2 Access
Summary: The Terraform plan will be applied to create an IAM role and policy, enabling an EC2 instance to read from S3. This step ensures that the resources are provisioned as specified in the configuration.

Timestamp: 2025-01-26T16:31:55.395125
Tagline: Retrying Terraform Configuration Deployment
Summary: The initial attempt to apply the Terraform configuration timed out, possibly due to a temporary issue. Retrying the command aims to successfully provision the resources needed.

Timestamp: 2025-01-26T16:32:16.459885
Tagline: Correcting invalid AWS availability zone
Summary: The availability zone 'us-west-1a' in the 'aws_instance' resource is incorrect. We will update it to a valid zone to ensure proper deployment.

Timestamp: 2025-01-26T16:32:23.349191
Tagline: Reapplying Terraform for Resource Provisioning
Summary: The availability zone error has been resolved, allowing us to proceed with applying the Terraform configuration. This step will provision the necessary resources as defined in the configuration.

Timestamp: 2025-01-26T16:32:33.688079
Tagline: Retrying Terraform deployment with corrections
Summary: The Terraform configuration will be reapplied to provision resources after correcting the invalid availability zone. This step ensures that the infrastructure is deployed correctly without errors.

Timestamp: 2025-01-26T16:32:44.547557
