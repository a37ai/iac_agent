Timestamp: 2025-01-31T16:49:22.167643
Tagline: Checking Prometheus Installation Status
Summary: The command 'which prometheus' is executed to determine if Prometheus is installed and accessible in the system's PATH. This verification step ensures that the necessary prerequisites are met before continuing with further setup or configuration.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T16:49:56.342406
Tagline: Verifying Node Exporter Installation Status
Summary: The playbook will execute a command to check if Node Exporter is installed on the system. This step is crucial to determine the next actions needed for setting up monitoring tools.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T16:50:28.717398
Tagline: Install Prometheus using Homebrew
Summary: Prometheus is not installed on the system, as indicated by the check. We will install Prometheus via Homebrew to ensure monitoring capabilities are set up.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T16:51:10.382655
Tagline: Installing Node Exporter with Homebrew
Summary: Node Exporter is not currently installed, as indicated by the previous error. This step will install Node Exporter using Homebrew to ensure system metrics can be collected.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T16:51:47.710906
Tagline: Deploying Prometheus Configuration Template
Summary: The Prometheus configuration template is being copied to the specified target directory to complete the setup. This step follows the installation of Prometheus and Node Exporter, ensuring proper configuration for monitoring.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T16:52:10.492293
Tagline: Copying Prometheus Configuration Template
Summary: The Prometheus configuration template will be copied to the specified destination. This action corrects a previous error where the template path was not provided, ensuring proper configuration deployment.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T16:52:31.485677
Tagline: Deploying Correct Prometheus Configuration Template
Summary: The action involves deploying the Prometheus configuration template to the specified destination. This resolves previous failures caused by an incorrect template path, ensuring proper monitoring setup.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T16:53:22.788451
Tagline: Ensure valid template path in deployment
Summary: The Prometheus configuration deployment task will be updated to use a defined variable for the template file path. This change prevents NoneType errors by ensuring the template path is always valid.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T16:53:58.793506
Tagline: Deploy updated Prometheus configuration swiftly
Summary: Re-running the Ansible playbook will deploy the updated Prometheus configuration and start necessary services. This ensures Prometheus and Node Exporter are correctly configured and operational after recent modifications.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T16:54:25.251055
Tagline: Optimize playbook by disabling fact gathering
Summary: The playbook execution failed during the 'Gathering Facts' step on macOS. To prevent this error and streamline the process, fact gathering will be disabled by adding 'gather_facts: no' to the playbook header.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T16:54:48.406722
Tagline: Re-testing Ansible Playbook on Mac OS
Summary: The ansible-playbook command will be re-executed to ensure the playbook functions correctly after disabling fact gathering and correcting the template path. This step is crucial to validate the recent changes and confirm successful execution on Mac OS.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T16:55:14.986862
Tagline: Enhancing Prometheus Installation Verification
Summary: The task updates the Prometheus installation check to use 'which prometheus' instead of 'brew list | grep prometheus'. This change ensures accurate detection of the Prometheus binary on Mac OS, aligning with the intended functionality.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T16:55:46.255335
Tagline: Ensure Prometheus detection on Mac OS
Summary: The code will be updated to include an environment variable that expands the PATH for tasks checking Prometheus and Node Exporter. This ensures the 'which prometheus' command functions correctly on Mac OS by including Homebrew binary paths.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T16:56:17.584885
Tagline: Enhancing Environment Variable Retrieval Method
Summary: The code will be updated to use lookup('env','PATH') for retrieving environment variables, ensuring compatibility when fact gathering is disabled. This change prevents errors caused by the unavailability of 'ansible_env.PATH'.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T16:56:45.798792
Tagline: Ensure robust environment variable handling
Summary: The code will be updated to provide a default value for the PATH environment variable during Prometheus and Node Exporter installation checks. This ensures that the PATH is always valid, preventing errors when the lookup returns None.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T16:57:10.163387
Tagline: Enhance Mac OS compatibility for tasks
Summary: The environment variables in the tasks for checking Prometheus and Node Exporter installations will be updated to include /opt/homebrew/bin in the PATH. This adjustment is necessary to ensure compatibility with Mac OS, particularly on M1 chips, where Homebrew installs binaries in this directory.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T16:57:45.530956
Tagline: Validate Ansible Playbook Post-Modification
Summary: The Ansible playbook will be rerun to ensure successful execution of tasks, including the 'which prometheus' check, after recent modifications. This step is crucial to confirm that the updates and installations have resolved previous issues on Mac OS.
