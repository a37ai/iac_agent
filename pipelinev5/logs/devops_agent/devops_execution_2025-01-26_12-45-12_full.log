rollback_commits

description:
Rollback the last commit to address the issue of no changes being made in the main Terraform configuration file.

content:
None

reasoning:
The validation step indicated that no changes were made to the main Terraform configuration file, which contradicts the expected outcome of defining the EC2 instance resource. Rolling back the last commit will allow us to correct this and ensure the necessary changes are applied.
