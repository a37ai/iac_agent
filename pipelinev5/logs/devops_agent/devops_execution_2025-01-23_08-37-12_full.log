rsync -av --exclude='*.tfstate' --exclude='*.tfstate.backup' --exclude='*.log' /tmp/temp-repo/ /Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/ --dry-run

reasoning:
The current step involves using rsync to compare the most recent push with the current deployed code, excluding certain files. A dry-run is specified to ensure no actual changes are made, allowing us to safely review the differences.

Execute the rsync command to perform a dry-run comparison of the most recent push with the current deployed code, excluding specified files.

content:
rsync -av --exclude='*.tfstate' --exclude='*.tfstate.backup' --exclude='*.log' /tmp/temp-repo/ /Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/ --dry-run

reasoning:
The dry-run of the rsync command was executed successfully, indicating that the command is correct. Now, we need to execute it again to ensure the comparison is accurate and to confirm the changes that would be made without actually applying them.
