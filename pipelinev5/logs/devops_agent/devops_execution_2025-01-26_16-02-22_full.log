description:
Update the EC2 instance resource in main.tf to use the correct variable names as specified.

content:
None

reasoning:
The task requires updating the variable names in the Terraform configuration file to ensure the correct variables are used for the EC2 instance resource. This is necessary for the Terraform script to function as intended with the correct parameters.

reasoning:
The task requires ensuring that the variables 'additional_ami_id' and 'additional_instance_type' are defined in the variables.tf file. Currently, these variables are not present, so we need to add them with appropriate descriptions and default values if necessary.

Create a Terraform variables file named 'terraform.tfvars' to provide values for 'additional_ami_id' and 'additional_instance_type'.

content:
additional_ami_id = "ami-12345678"
additional_instance_type = "t2.micro"

reasoning:
The previous attempt to execute Terraform failed because the variables were not provided in a recognized format. By creating a 'terraform.tfvars' file, we can ensure that Terraform automatically picks up the variable values during execution.
