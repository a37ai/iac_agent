Install Terraform CLI and configure AWS credentials using the correct command syntax.

content:
None

reasoning:
The previous command failed due to a syntax error. We need to ensure Terraform is installed and AWS credentials are configured correctly. The error 'name sys is not defined' suggests there was an issue with the command execution environment, possibly due to incorrect command chaining or syntax.

reasoning:
The previous command failed due to an undefined 'sys' error, which is likely unrelated to the command itself. To ensure Terraform and AWS CLI are installed and configured correctly, I'll separate the installation and configuration steps.

reasoning:
The previous attempts to install Terraform and configure AWS credentials in a single command resulted in an error related to 'sys'. To isolate the issue, I will first check if Terraform is installed and install it if necessary, then separately configure AWS credentials.

None

reasoning:
Terraform is installed, but AWS CLI needs to be configured to allow Terraform to interact with AWS. The credentials should be available in the specified path, so we can proceed with configuring AWS CLI.

description:
Request human intervention to resolve the 'name 'sys' is not defined' error.

content:
None

reasoning:
The repeated error 'name 'sys' is not defined' suggests there might be an issue with the environment or the command execution context that requires human intervention to diagnose and fix. This error is not typical for command execution and may indicate a deeper issue with the system setup or the execution environment.
