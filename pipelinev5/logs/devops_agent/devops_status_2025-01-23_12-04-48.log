Tagline: Provisioning infrastructure with Terraform apply
Summary: The Terraform configuration will be applied to provision the specified resources, including an EC2 instance with the given AMI ID and instance type. This follows a successful backend reconfiguration, ensuring the infrastructure is set up correctly.

Timestamp: 2025-01-23T12:06:03.485972
Tagline: Reapplying Terraform for Infrastructure Setup
Summary: The Terraform apply command is being re-executed to provision infrastructure after successfully reconfiguring the backend. This ensures that the specified resources are correctly set up following the initial failure due to backend issues.

Timestamp: 2025-01-23T12:06:07.524946
Tagline: Reinitializing Terraform backend for stability
Summary: The Terraform initialization is being re-executed to address backend setup issues that caused previous configuration applications to fail. This step aims to resolve these issues, ensuring a successful execution of the subsequent Terraform apply command.

Timestamp: 2025-01-23T12:06:25.239764
Tagline: Reinitialize Terraform Backend and Apply Config
Summary: The Terraform configuration will be reinitialized to address backend issues that caused previous failures. This ensures the backend is correctly configured before applying the infrastructure changes.

Timestamp: 2025-01-23T12:06:31.457625
Tagline: Reconfiguring and Applying Terraform Setup
Summary: Re-running Terraform initialization with reconfiguration ensures the backend is correctly set up. This step addresses previous initialization issues, allowing the configuration to be applied smoothly.

Timestamp: 2025-01-23T12:06:37.631551
Tagline: Human intervention needed for Terraform backend
Summary: Terraform backend configuration issues persist despite automated attempts to resolve them. A manual review and correction of the backend setup in the configuration files is required.
