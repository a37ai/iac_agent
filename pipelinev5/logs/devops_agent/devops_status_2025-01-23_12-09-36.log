Summary: The Terraform apply command will be retried with an increased timeout to address previous failures due to timeouts and errors. This adjustment aims to ensure successful initialization and plugin setup, which may take longer than anticipated.

Timestamp: 2025-01-23T12:10:57.817568
Tagline: Increasing timeout for Terraform deployment
Summary: The Terraform apply command will be retried with an increased timeout to ensure successful completion. Previous attempts failed due to insufficient time for initialization and application processes.

Timestamp: 2025-01-23T12:11:05.301640
Tagline: Separate Terraform Commands for Issue Diagnosis
Summary: Executing 'terraform init' and 'terraform apply' separately to pinpoint the source of previous failures. This approach helps determine if the issue lies with initialization, state, or provider plugins.

Timestamp: 2025-01-23T12:11:15.088537
Tagline: Separate Terraform steps for issue diagnosis
Summary: Executing 'terraform init' and 'terraform apply' separately to identify the source of failure. This approach allows for detailed error analysis by isolating initialization from application processes.

Timestamp: 2025-01-23T12:11:23.849823
Tagline: Extending timeout for Terraform execution
Summary: The Terraform apply command is being executed with an increased timeout to ensure successful completion. This adjustment addresses previous failures caused by the default timeout being insufficient for the initialization and application processes.

Timestamp: 2025-01-23T12:11:31.109138
Tagline: Human intervention needed for Terraform issue
Summary: The Terraform apply command is failing, indicating potential issues with configuration, AWS credentials, or network connectivity. Manual inspection is required to diagnose and resolve the problem.

Timestamp: 2025-01-23T12:12:14.023724
Tagline: Manual Review Needed for Terraform Failures
Summary: The Terraform apply command is failing due to potential issues with configuration, AWS credentials, or network connectivity. Human intervention is required to inspect these areas and resolve the persistent problem.
