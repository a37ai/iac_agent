  "codebase_context": "Overview:\n# Comprehensive Overview of the Mono Repository\n\nThis analysis provides a detailed overview of the mono repository, focusing on architecture, DevOps, and operational aspects. The repository is centered around provisioning AWS infrastructure using Terraform.\n\n## 1. Overall Architecture\n\n### High-Level System Design\nThe repository is designed to provision AWS EC2 instances using Terraform, an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool. The architecture is simple and consists of Terraform configuration files that define AWS resources.\n\n### Design Patterns and Principles\n- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The repository leverages Terraform to manage infrastructure through code, ensuring consistency and repeatability.\n- **Parameterization:** Use of variables to allow dynamic configuration of the infrastructure, enhancing flexibility and reusability.\n\n### System Boundaries and Interfaces\n- **Terraform CLI:** Acts as the primary interface for executing the infrastructure provisioning scripts.\n- **AWS API:** Serves as the boundary for interacting with AWS services to create and manage resources.\n\n## 2. Development Infrastructure\n\n### Technology Stack\n- **Terraform:** For defining and provisioning infrastructure.\n- **AWS:** As the cloud provider for hosting the infrastructure.\n\n### Key Dependencies\n- **Terraform:** Required for executing the IaC scripts.\n- **AWS Provider:** Necessary for Terraform to interact with AWS resources.\n\n### Development Tools and Requirements\n- **Terraform CLI:** For running the scripts.\n- **AWS CLI:** For managing AWS credentials and configurations.\n\n## 3. DevOps Infrastructure\n\n### Deployment Architecture\nThe deployment architecture is based on Terraform scripts that define the desired state of AWS infrastructure, which is then applied using the Terraform CLI.\n\n### Infrastructure as Code Setup\n- **Main Terraform File (`main.tf`):** Contains the core configuration for provisioning an EC2 instance.\n- **Variables File (`variables.tf`):** Manages input parameters for dynamic configuration.\n- **Outputs File (`outputs.tf`):** Defines outputs to extract information about the provisioned resources.\n\n### Configuration Management Approach\nThe configuration is managed through Terraform variables, allowing for environment-specific customization.\n\n### Service Dependencies and Integration Points\n- **AWS EC2:** The primary service being provisioned.\n- **AWS IAM:** For managing access and permissions.\n\n## 4. Environment Management\n\n### Development, Staging, and Production Environments\nThe repository does not explicitly define separate environments but can be extended to do so by using different variable files or workspaces in Terraform.\n\n### Environment-Specific Configurations\nEnvironment-specific configurations can be managed through Terraform variables and different state files.\n\n### Environment Promotion Strategy\nPromotion between environments can be achieved by applying Terraform configurations to different AWS accounts or regions.\n\n### Configuration and Secret Management\nSecrets such as AWS credentials are expected to be managed through environment variables or AWS IAM roles.\n\n## 5. CI/CD Pipeline\n\n### Build and Deployment Processes\nThe repository does not include explicit CI/CD pipeline configurations but can be integrated with CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI for automated deployment.\n\n### Testing Strategies\n- **Terraform Plan:** Used to preview changes before applying them.\n- **Manual Validation:** Ensures the infrastructure is provisioned as expected.\n\n### Deployment Strategies\n- **Direct Deployment:** The current setup implies direct application of Terraform scripts. Advanced strategies like blue-green or canary deployments are not implemented but can be considered for future improvements.\n\n### Release Management\nVersion control of Terraform scripts ensures traceability and rollback capabilities.\n\n## 6. Operational Considerations\n\n### Monitoring and Logging Setup\nThe repository does not include monitoring or logging configurations. Integration with AWS CloudWatch or third-party tools can be considered.\n\n### Security Measures\n- **IAM Roles and Policies:** Should be used to manage access to AWS resources.\n- **Environment Variables:** For managing sensitive information like AWS credentials.\n\n### Scalability Provisions\nThe current setup provisions a single EC2 instance. Scalability can be enhanced by using Terraform modules to manage multiple instances or auto-scaling groups.\n\n### Backup and Disaster Recovery\nThe repository does not include backup strategies. AWS services like S3 and RDS snapshots can be integrated for backup and recovery.\n\n## 7. Areas for Improvement\n\n### Technical Debt\n- **Lack of CI/CD Integration:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.\n- **Environment Management:** Define separate configurations for different environments.\n\n### Security Considerations\n- **Secret Management:** Implement a more robust secret management solution, such as AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault.\n\n### Scalability Concerns\n- **Auto-Scaling:** Consider implementing auto-scaling for EC2 instances to handle varying loads.\n\n### DevOps Pipeline Optimization\n- **Automated Testing:** Introduce automated tests for Terraform configurations.\n- **Advanced Deployment Strategies:** Explore blue-green or canary deployments for safer rollouts.\n\nThis analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the mono repository and suggests areas for future enhancements to improve its architecture, DevOps practices, and operational efficiency.\n\nFile Structure:\n{\"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate.backup\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/outputs.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/main.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/README.md\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/variables.tf\": \"file\"}\n\nRelevant Files:\n{\n  \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/main.tf\": \"terraform {\\n  required_version = \\\">= 0.11.0\\\"\\n}\\n\\nprovider \\\"aws\\\" {\\n  region = \\\"${var.aws_region}\\\"\\n}\\n\\nresource \\\"aws_instance\\\" \\\"ubuntu\\\" {\\n  ami           = \\\"${var.ami_id}\\\"\\n  instance_type = \\\"${var.instance_type}\\\"\\n  availability_zone = \\\"${var.aws_region}a\\\"\\n\\n  tags {\\n    Name = \\\"${var.name}\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n\"\n}\n",

Environment Management\n\n### Development, Staging, and Production Environments\nThe repository does not explicitly define separate environments but can be extended to do so by using different variable files or workspaces in Terraform.\n\n### Environment-Specific Configurations\nEnvironment-specific configurations can be managed through Terraform variables and different state files.\n\n### Environment Promotion Strategy\nPromotion between environments can be achieved by applying Terraform configurations to different AWS accounts or regions.\n\n### Configuration and Secret Management\nSecrets such as AWS credentials are expected to be managed through environment variables or AWS IAM roles.\n\n## 5. CI/CD Pipeline\n\n### Build and Deployment Processes\nThe repository does not include explicit CI/CD pipeline configurations but can be integrated with CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI for automated deployment.\n\n### Testing Strategies\n- **Terraform Plan:** Used to preview changes before applying them.\n- **Manual Validation:** Ensures the infrastructure is provisioned as expected.\n\n### Deployment Strategies\n- **Direct Deployment:** The current setup implies direct application of Terraform scripts. Advanced strategies like blue-green or canary deployments are not implemented but can be considered for future improvements.\n\n### Release Management\nVersion control of Terraform scripts ensures traceability and rollback capabilities.\n\n## 6. Operational Considerations\n\n### Monitoring and Logging Setup\nThe repository does not include monitoring or logging configurations. Integration with AWS CloudWatch or third-party tools can be considered.\n\n### Security Measures\n- **IAM Roles and Policies:** Should be used to manage access to AWS resources.\n- **Environment Variables:** For managing sensitive information like AWS credentials.\n\n### Scalability Provisions\nThe current setup provisions a single EC2 instance. Scalability can be enhanced by using Terraform modules to manage multiple instances or auto-scaling groups.\n\n### Backup and Disaster Recovery\nThe repository does not include backup strategies. AWS services like S3 and RDS snapshots can be integrated for backup and recovery.\n\n## 7. Areas for Improvement\n\n### Technical Debt\n- **Lack of CI/CD Integration:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.\n- **Environment Management:** Define separate configurations for different environments.\n\n### Security Considerations\n- **Secret Management:** Implement a more robust secret management solution, such as AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault.\n\n### Scalability Concerns\n- **Auto-Scaling:** Consider implementing auto-scaling for EC2 instances to handle varying loads.\n\n### DevOps Pipeline Optimization\n- **Automated Testing:** Introduce automated tests for Terraform configurations.\n- **Advanced Deployment Strategies:** Explore blue-green or canary deployments for safer rollouts.\n\nThis analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the mono repository and suggests areas for future enhancements to improve its architecture, DevOps practices, and operational efficiency.\n\nFile Structure:\n{\"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate.backup\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/outputs.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/terraform.tfstate\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/main.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/README.md\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/variables.tf\": \"file\"}\n\nRelevant Files:\n{\n  \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev4/test_repos/main.tf\": \"terraform {\\n  required_version = \\\">= 0.11.0\\\"\\n}\\n\\nresource \\\"aws_instance\\\" \\\"another_instance\\\" {\\n  ami           = var.ami_id\\n  instance_type = var.instance_type\\n  tags = {\\n    Name = \\\"AnotherInstance\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nresource \\\"aws_instance\\\" \\\"new_instance\\\" {\\n  ami           = var.ami_id\\n  instance_type = var.instance_type\\n  tags = {\\n    Name = \\\"NewInstance\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nprovider \\\"aws\\\" {\\n  region = \\\"${var.aws_region}\\\"\\n}\\n\\nresource \\\"aws_instance\\\" \\\"ubuntu\\\" {\\n  ami           = \\\"${var.ami_id}\\\"\\n  instance_type = \\\"${var.instance_type}\\\"\\n  availability_zone = \\\"${var.aws_region}a\\\"\\n\\n  tags {\\n    Name = \\\"${var.name}\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n\"\n}\n",

The repository is centered around provisioning AWS infrastructure using Terraform.\n\n## 1. Overall Architecture\n\n### High-Level System Design\nThe repository is designed to provision AWS EC2 instances using Terraform, an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool. The architecture is simple and consists of Terraform configuration files that define AWS resources.\n\n### Design Patterns and Principles\n- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The repository leverages Terraform to manage infrastructure through code, ensuring consistency and repeatability.\n- **Parameterization:** Use of variables to allow dynamic configuration of the infrastructure, enhancing flexibility and reusability.\n\n### System Boundaries and Interfaces\n- **Terraform CLI:** Acts as the primary interface for executing the infrastructure provisioning scripts.\n- **AWS API:** Serves as the boundary for interacting with AWS services to create and manage resources.\n\n## 2. Development Infrastructure\n\n### Technology Stack\n- **Terraform:** For defining and provisioning infrastructure.\n- **AWS:** As the cloud provider for hosting the infrastructure.\n\n### Key Dependencies\n- **Terraform:** Required for executing the IaC scripts.\n- **AWS Provider:** Necessary for Terraform to interact with AWS resources.\n\n### Development Tools and Requirements\n- **Terraform CLI:** For running the scripts.\n- **AWS CLI:** For managing AWS credentials and configurations.\n\n## 3.
