Tagline: Integrating New EC2 Instance in Terraform
Summary: A new EC2 instance configuration will be added to the Terraform main configuration file using default parameters. This modification ensures the infrastructure setup includes the specified resource block for deployment.

Timestamp: 2025-01-19T15:23:33.525729
Tagline: Validating EC2 instance configuration changes
Summary: Executing 'terraform plan' to verify the correctness of the new EC2 instance configuration. This step ensures that any potential issues are identified before applying changes to the infrastructure.

Timestamp: 2025-01-19T15:23:37.985742
Tagline: Remove invalid Python import in Terraform
Summary: An invalid Python import statement was detected in the Terraform configuration file, causing errors during the 'terraform plan' execution. Removing this statement will rectify the syntax issue and allow the Terraform process to proceed smoothly.

Timestamp: 2025-01-19T15:23:43.780445
Tagline: Validating Terraform Configuration Post-Update
Summary: Running 'terraform plan' to confirm the configuration's validity after removing an incorrect Python import statement. This ensures the setup is correct and ready for deployment.

Timestamp: 2025-01-19T15:23:49.817452
Tagline: Correcting Terraform Configuration Syntax Error
Summary: The Terraform file contains an unclosed configuration block for an EC2 instance, causing a syntax error. This action will ensure the block is properly closed with a brace to allow successful execution of the Terraform plan.

Timestamp: 2025-01-19T15:23:56.667623
Tagline: Validate Terraform configuration post-fix.
Summary: Running 'terraform plan' checks the validity of the fixed configuration. This ensures the recent corrections resolved errors and previews upcoming infrastructure changes.

Timestamp: 2025-01-19T15:24:04.426454
Tagline: Correcting Terraform Tags Configuration Error
Summary: The 'tags' block in the Terraform configuration is incorrectly defined and needs to be changed to an argument with an equals sign. This correction will resolve the error and ensure successful execution of the Terraform plan.

Timestamp: 2025-01-19T15:24:12.280893
Tagline: Verifying Terraform Configuration Accuracy
Summary: The 'terraform plan' command will be executed to ensure the recent changes, specifically the correction in the 'tags' block, have resolved any configuration issues. This step is crucial to confirm that the infrastructure setup is valid and ready for deployment.

Timestamp: 2025-01-19T15:24:18.797535
Tagline: Provisioning new EC2 instance with Terraform
Summary: The Terraform configuration has been validated successfully, confirming its correctness. The next step is to execute the configuration to provision a new EC2 instance as specified in the Terraform files.

Timestamp: 2025-01-19T15:24:42.762441
Tagline: Correcting invalid availability zone setting
Summary: The Terraform configuration file will be updated to change the availability zone from 'us-west-1a' to 'us-west-1b'. This modification aims to resolve the error by using a valid availability zone in the specified AWS region.

Timestamp: 2025-01-19T15:24:48.793869
Tagline: Provisioning EC2 instances with Terraform
Summary: The Terraform configuration will be applied to provision EC2 instances after correcting an invalid availability zone error. This ensures the infrastructure is deployed as intended.

Timestamp: 2025-01-19T15:25:11.136128
Tagline: Infrastructure Deployment Successfully Finalized
Summary: The EC2 instance configuration has been integrated into the Terraform main file and applied without errors. All required infrastructure changes are complete, with no further tasks needed at this time.

Timestamp: 2025-01-19T15:25:19.520223
Tagline: Expose EC2 Instance Public DNS Output
Summary: The outputs.tf file will be updated to include a new output block that exposes the public DNS of the newly created EC2 instance. This modification is necessary to ensure that the public DNS can be easily accessed and utilized in subsequent configurations or operations.
