Total Steps: 7

=== Execution Plan ===

Step 1:
Description: Create the base Ansible playbook file for Prometheus installation with proper header and settings.
Type: code
Files: /Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/prometheus_playbook.yml

Step 2:
Description: Add a task to check if Prometheus is already installed by using the 'which prometheus' command.
Type: code
Files: /Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/prometheus_playbook.yml

Step 3:
Description: Add a task to install Prometheus via Homebrew if it is not installed.
Type: code
Files: /Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/prometheus_playbook.yml

Step 4:
Description: Add a task to check if the Prometheus configuration file already exists at the destination.
Type: code
Files: /Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/prometheus_playbook.yml

Step 5:
Description: Add a task to deploy the Prometheus configuration file from the Jinja2 template if it does not already exist.
Type: code
Files: /Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/prometheus_playbook.yml

Step 6:
Description: Add a task to restart Prometheus service using Homebrew to apply configuration changes.
Type: code
Files: /Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/prometheus_playbook.yml

Step 7:
Description: Add a task to test Prometheus by fetching a snippet of metrics output to verify scraping is working.
Type: code
Files: /Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/prometheus_playbook.yml

reasoning:
The current step requires us to create the base playbook file with the specified content for installing Prometheus on Mac OS.

Add a new task to check if Prometheus is installed using the 'which prometheus' command in the playbook.

content:
None

reasoning:
The current step requires inserting a task in the playbook to verify if Prometheus is installed. We need to update the 'tasks' section in /Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/prometheus_playbook.yml to include this new task.

description:
Append a new task to install Prometheus via Homebrew if it is not already installed within the playbook.

content:
None

reasoning:
The next step requires that if the Prometheus installation check fails (i.e. when 'which prometheus' returns non-zero), a task should run to install Prometheus using Homebrew. We add this task right after the debug task.
