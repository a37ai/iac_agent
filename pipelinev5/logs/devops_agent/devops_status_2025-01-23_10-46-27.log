Tagline: Terraform configuration tasks successfully finalized
Summary: The variable naming consistency in the Terraform configuration has been ensured by updating the EC2 instance configuration in 'main.tf'. All tasks have been completed, and no further actions are necessary.

Timestamp: 2025-01-23T10:46:52.356884
Tagline: Set default AMI ID for Terraform.
Summary: A default value for the 'new_ami_id' variable is added to 'variables.tf' to ensure Terraform can run without user input. This change aligns with the practice of providing default values for variables, enhancing automation consistency.
