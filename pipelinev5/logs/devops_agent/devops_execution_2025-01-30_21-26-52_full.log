Request the content of the package.json file to proceed with adding the test command.

content:
None

reasoning:
The previous attempts to modify the package.json file were unsuccessful because the file content was not provided. To add the test command, I need the current content of the package.json file to make the necessary modifications.

description:
Request human intervention to create a package.json file.

content:
None

reasoning:
The execution history indicates that the package.json file does not exist, which is necessary to add the test command. A human needs to create this file before I can proceed with adding the test script.
