Description: Ensure variable naming consistency in the Terraform configuration
Type: code
Files: /Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/main.tf, /Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/variables.tf

Action Details:
tool_type:
modify_code

description:
Update the EC2 instance resource definition in main.tf to ensure variable naming consistency with variables.tf.

content:
None

reasoning:
The current Terraform configuration in main.tf uses var.ami_id and var.instance_type, which are consistent with the variable definitions in variables.tf. Therefore, no changes are needed to the variable names in main.tf. However, to ensure consistency, I will verify and confirm that the variable names in main.tf match those in variables.tf.

Check the Terraform error log for detailed error information.

content:
None

reasoning:
The previous attempts to apply the Terraform configuration failed with an error. We need to understand the specific error details to troubleshoot effectively. The 'terraform_error.log' file was created in a previous step, so we should examine its contents to identify the root cause of the failure.

description:
Request human intervention to diagnose the persistent Terraform apply error.

content:
None

reasoning:
The repeated attempts to apply the Terraform configuration have failed with an error, and the error logs do not provide sufficient information to diagnose the issue. Human intervention is needed to investigate the error further, possibly by checking AWS console for any issues or reviewing the Terraform configuration in detail.
