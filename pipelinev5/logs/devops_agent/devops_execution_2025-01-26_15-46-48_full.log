None

reasoning:
The current step requires defining the AWS provider configuration in the Terraform file. The existing code in 'main.tf' already includes a provider block, but it uses an older syntax for variable interpolation. Updating the syntax to the latest version will ensure compatibility with newer Terraform versions.
