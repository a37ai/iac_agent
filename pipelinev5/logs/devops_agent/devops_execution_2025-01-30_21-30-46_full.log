Description: Create a new GitHub Actions workflow file for CI pipeline
Type: code
Files: .github/workflows/ci.yml

Action Details:
tool_type:
create_file

description:
Create a new GitHub Actions workflow file for the CI pipeline.

content:
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with GitHub Actions

name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test

    - name: Build
      run: npm run build


reasoning:
The task requires creating a new file named 'ci.yml' in the '.github/workflows' directory to set up a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions. This is the first step in establishing the CI/CD pipeline as per the DevOps infrastructure outlined in the codebase context.

        run: echo 'Workflow execution successful!'

reasoning:
The current step involves defining the basic structure of the GitHub Actions workflow. Since the content for the workflow is already provided, the next logical step is to create the file with this content in the specified location.

description:
Install 'act' and run 'act push -b main' to test the GitHub Actions workflow locally.

content:
None

reasoning:
The current step requires testing the GitHub Actions workflow locally using 'act'. First, we need to ensure 'act' is installed, and then we can run the command to test the workflow.

Attempt to install 'act' using npm and run the GitHub Actions workflow locally.

None

reasoning:
The previous attempt to run 'act' failed due to an incorrect command. According to the documentation, 'act' can be installed using npm. I will install 'act' using npm and then run the workflow locally to test it.
