Running ansible command to check if Homebrew is installed on the Mac OS machine.

content:
None

reasoning:
We need to verify the installation of Homebrew as described in the current step. Using Ansible with the shell module to execute 'which brew' will return the path if Homebrew is installed.

reasoning:
The current step instructs us to install Homebrew if it is not already installed. Since the previous step verified its absence, I'm executing the given Ansible command to perform the installation.

Re-run Homebrew installation on Mac OS without sudo escalation.

reasoning:
The previous attempt using '--become' caused a failure because it invoked sudo, and on Mac OS the Homebrew installer should run as the normal user. Removing the '--become' flag should resolve the error.

Execute Homebrew installation non-interactively by setting NONINTERACTIVE=1 and not using become.

content:
None

reasoning:
Previous attempts to run the Homebrew install script with sudo (--become) led to errors due to a required password prompt. Since we are running on MacOS and Homebrew should be installed as a non-root user (and the installation script supports non-interactive mode via the NONINTERACTIVE=1 flag), we remove the sudo (become) flag and run the command with NONINTERACTIVE=1 to bypass interactive prompts.

description:
Homebrew installation requires interactive sudo authentication.

content:
None

reasoning:
The Homebrew installation script is failing because it requires a sudo password for elevated privileges. Running it non-interactively with Ansible (even with NONINTERACTIVE=1) causes it to exit with code 2 as the sudo password prompt cannot be handled automatically. At this point, we need to either run the installation manually in an interactive terminal or adjust the execution environment to allow an interactive sudo prompt. Please advise how to proceed: would you like to run the Homebrew installation manually, or adjust the strategy to allow for interactive sudo authentication?
