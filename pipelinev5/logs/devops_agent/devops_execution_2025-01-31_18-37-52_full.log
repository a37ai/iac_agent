reasoning:
The Terraform installation is out-of-date and the 'brew upgrade terraform' command did not update it because it reported Terraform 1.5.7 already installed. Running 'brew update' will update the Homebrew repository and then allow us to upgrade Terraform to the latest version (1.10.5).

Because even after manually installing terraform version 1.10.5, the output is still showing version v1.5.7. This likely indicates that another older binary is being picked up in the system PATH. Running 'which terraform' will help us identify where the current binary is located.

reasoning:
The 'which terraform' command shows that the outdated Terraform binary (v1.5.7) is located in /opt/homebrew/bin, which is taking precedence over the manually installed v1.10.5 in /usr/local/bin. Removing /opt/homebrew/bin/terraform will allow the system to use the updated Terraform binary in /usr/local/bin.
