description:
Check if the 'getent' and 'useradd' commands are available on the system.

content:
None

reasoning:
The previous attempt to check and create the 'prometheus' user failed because the 'getent' and 'useradd' commands were not found. We need to verify if these commands are available on the system or if they need to be installed.

description:
Request human intervention to install missing commands.

content:
None

reasoning:
The commands 'getent' and 'useradd' are not found on the system, which is causing the exit code 127 error. These commands are typically part of the base system on most Linux distributions. A human intervention is needed to install the necessary packages that provide these commands, such as 'passwd' and 'shadow-utils' on some distributions.
