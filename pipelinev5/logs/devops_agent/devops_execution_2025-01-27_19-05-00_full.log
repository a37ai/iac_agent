description:
Initialize Terraform to ensure the configuration is set up correctly before applying any changes.

content:
None

reasoning:
Before applying the Terraform configuration, it's important to initialize Terraform to set up the backend and download any necessary provider plugins. This ensures that the configuration is ready to be applied without errors.
