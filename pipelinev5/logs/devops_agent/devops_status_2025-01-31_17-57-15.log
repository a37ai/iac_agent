Timestamp: 2025-01-31T18:12:06.682261
Tagline: Verify Prometheus node metrics collection
Summary: This action involves checking Prometheus's active targets to confirm that node metrics are being scraped from 'localhost:9100'. Ensuring this target is present verifies that the node exporter is correctly configured and operational.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T18:12:22.755177
Tagline: Verifying Node Exporter Functionality
Summary: The system will query the node exporter's metrics endpoint to confirm it is operational. This step is necessary because the Prometheus target check for 'localhost:9100' failed, suggesting the node exporter might not be running.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T18:14:06.913081
Tagline: Verify Node Exporter on Port 9100
Summary: The system will check if any process is listening on port 9100 to determine if Node Exporter is running. This is necessary because previous attempts to access metrics from this port were unsuccessful.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T18:15:14.067057
Tagline: Verifying node_exporter installation status
Summary: The system will check if node_exporter is installed via Homebrew by listing its version. This step is necessary because Prometheus is unable to access metrics, indicating node_exporter might not be running or installed.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T18:15:47.759784
Tagline: Initiating Node Exporter for Metrics Collection
Summary: The node_exporter service will be started using Homebrew to allow Prometheus to collect node metrics. This action is necessary because the service is installed but not currently running, preventing access to metrics on port 9100.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T18:16:05.837645
Tagline: Verifying Node Exporter Service Status
Summary: Checking Homebrew services to ensure node_exporter is active and running. This step is crucial to confirm that metrics are being served correctly on port 9100.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T18:16:29.638190
Tagline: Restarting node_exporter for metric collection
Summary: The node_exporter service will be restarted to address connectivity issues on port 9100. This action aims to resolve transient problems and ensure Prometheus can successfully scrape node metrics.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T18:17:12.848837
Tagline: Verify node exporter process status
Summary: The node exporter metrics endpoint is unresponsive, suggesting a potential issue with the process. Checking if the node exporter is running will help diagnose the connectivity problem.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T18:17:30.362271
Tagline: Verify node exporter port status
Summary: Run sudo lsof on port 9100 to check if the node exporter is listening, addressing permission issues. This step ensures the service is correctly bound to the port, resolving curl access failures.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T18:20:27.146543
Tagline: Testing IPv6 connectivity for node metrics
Summary: The command will use IPv6 to query the node exporter metrics endpoint, as the previous attempt using IPv4 failed. This will help determine if the node exporter is accessible via IPv6, resolving the connectivity issue for Prometheus.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T18:20:51.471986
Tagline: Reloading Prometheus for new targets
Summary: The Prometheus configuration is being reloaded to include the node exporter as a scrape target. This ensures that Prometheus can now collect and analyze node metrics from 'localhost:9100'.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T18:21:15.639717
Tagline: Restarting Prometheus for configuration update
Summary: Prometheus will be restarted to apply the updated configuration, enabling it to scrape the node exporter on port 9100. This action is necessary because the lifecycle API reload is not enabled, requiring a full restart.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T18:22:06.732514
Tagline: Verify Node Exporter Target Presence
Summary: The task involves querying the Prometheus API targets endpoint to ensure the node exporter target at localhost:9100 is correctly listed. This step is necessary to confirm successful target registration and diagnose any previous errors in the scraping process.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T18:23:41.351648
Tagline: Verify Node Exporter in Prometheus Targets
Summary: The action involves checking the Prometheus API to ensure the 'node' scrape job is active. This verification is necessary because the initial check failed to confirm the presence of the node exporter using the expected endpoint.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T18:24:22.956639
Tagline: Inspecting Prometheus targets for node exporter
Summary: The command will retrieve the complete JSON output of Prometheus targets to check for the presence of the node exporter target. This step is necessary because the previous attempt to locate the target using a grep command failed, suggesting a possible labeling or configuration issue.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T18:25:26.138280
Tagline: Verify Prometheus node job presence
Summary: This action involves running a command to check if the Prometheus targets include a job labeled 'node'. The aim is to confirm that Prometheus is successfully scraping metrics from the node exporter by using a precise search pattern.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T18:26:37.938298
Tagline: Verify Prometheus Node Metrics Collection
Summary: The command will query the Prometheus targets API using grep -E to match the 'job':'node' target. This approach is necessary because macOS grep does not support the -P option, and it ensures that Prometheus is correctly scraping node metrics.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T18:26:55.894120
Tagline: Verify Node Job in Prometheus Targets
Summary: This action queries Prometheus targets using jq to ensure the node job is present. It replaces previous grep attempts, providing a more reliable method to confirm that Prometheus is correctly scraping node metrics.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T18:27:06.867436
Tagline: Prometheus Node Metrics Test Successful
Summary: The test confirmed that Prometheus is correctly scraping node metrics from the specified targets. No additional actions are necessary as the current setup is functioning as intended.
