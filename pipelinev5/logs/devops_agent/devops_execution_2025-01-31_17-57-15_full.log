Type: code
Files: /Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/prometheus_playbook.yml

Step 2:
Description: Add a task in the playbook to check if Prometheus is already installed using Homebrew.
Type: code
Files: /Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/prometheus_playbook.yml

Step 3:
Description: Add a task to install Prometheus using Homebrew if it is not already installed.
Type: code
Files: /Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/prometheus_playbook.yml

Step 4:
Description: Add a task to deploy the Prometheus configuration file using the provided Jinja2 template.
Type: code
Files: /Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/prometheus_playbook.yml, /Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/templates/prometheus.yml.j2

Step 5:
Description: Add a task to start Prometheus as a service on Mac OS using Homebrew services.
Type: code
Files: /Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/prometheus_playbook.yml

Step 6:
Description: Test that Prometheus is running by checking its health endpoint.
Type: code
Files: /Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/prometheus_playbook.yml

Create the Ansible playbook file with the specified YAML header and basic play definition for local installation on Mac OS.

content:
---
- hosts: localhost
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes
  vars:
    prometheus_config: "/usr/local/etc/prometheus.yml"
  tasks: []


reasoning:
The current step requires us to create the playbook file 'prometheus_playbook.yml' at the specified path with the provided content. This is a straightforward file creation step.

Update the Prometheus playbook to add a task for checking if Prometheus is already installed via Homebrew.

content:
None

reasoning:
The current step requires us to add a task that executes 'brew list --versions prometheus' and registers its result. We need to update the tasks section in the playbook to include this task instead of having an empty list.

Update the Prometheus playbook to use 'brew list --versions prometheus' for checking installation as per the current step.

content:
None

reasoning:
The task should explicitly check if Prometheus is installed using the '--versions' option. The current file contains 'brew list prometheus', so it needs to be updated.

Disable fact gathering to work around the SSH connection issues on Mac OS.

reasoning:
The error during 'Gathering Facts' indicates that using sudo with the default fact gathering might be causing problems on macOS. Since the playbook doesn't rely on gathered facts, changing 'gather_facts' from 'yes' to 'false' should allow the playbook to run and complete the 'Start Prometheus service' task without encountering these issues.

Modify the 'Start Prometheus service' task to override the play-level become setting so that it runs as the current user instead of root. This should help ensure Homebrew finds the correct PATH and functions properly on Mac OS.

content:
None

reasoning:
When running Homebrew commands, including brew services, it is important that they run as the installing user rather than with sudo. The playbook is set with become: yes at the play level, which causes all tasks to run with sudo. To avoid potential PATH issues and allow Homebrew to run correctly, we override this for the 'Start Prometheus service' task by setting become: no in that task.

Update the playbook to run Homebrew commands as the current user so that check and install tasks don't run with sudo. This should fix the exit code error from the 'Check if Prometheus is installed' task.

content:
None

reasoning:
The error is likely caused because brew commands are executed with become: yes (as root) by default from the playbook, but Homebrew on Mac OS should run as the current user. We already adjusted the 'Start Prometheus service' task to set 'become: no'. Now we need to add 'become: no' to both the 'Check if Prometheus is installed' and 'Install Prometheus if not installed' tasks.

Update the 'Check if Prometheus is installed' task to prevent failure by using the shell module with a fallback so that a non-zero exit code does not cause the playbook to fail.

content:
None

reasoning:
The task 'Check if Prometheus is installed' is causing an exit code 2 error despite having ignore_errors: yes. Replacing command with shell and appending '|| true' allows the task to succeed regardless, ensuring that subsequent tasks run. This change should help avoid the error encountered during the playbook run.

reasoning:
The tests indicate that Prometheus is configured to scrape metrics from localhost:9100, but commands to access that endpoint are failing. This usually means that the node_exporter isn’t running or installed. The next step is to verify if node_exporter is installed on the system using Homebrew.

Start node_exporter service via Homebrew to enable Prometheus to scrape node metrics.

content:
None

reasoning:
The tests indicate that while Prometheus is running, the node_exporter (which exposes metrics on port 9100) is not accessible. This is evidenced by the failure of 'curl http://localhost:9100/metrics' (exit code 7) and the absence of output from 'lsof -i :9100'. Since the node_exporter is installed (as confirmed by 'brew list --versions node_exporter'), the next step is to start the node_exporter service using Homebrew.

The earlier attempt to access http://localhost:9100/metrics failed with exit code 7, yet the node exporter process is confirmed running.

Query the Prometheus API targets endpoint to verify that the node exporter target on localhost:9100 is present in the scrape targets.

content:
None

reasoning:
Earlier, the attempt to grep for 'localhost:9100' from the API response returned an error, possibly due to a delay in scraping or target registration. Next, we should run the command without piping to grep so we can inspect the output manually and confirm that the node exporter target is listed.

Verify that the 'node' scrape job is present in Prometheus active targets.

reasoning:
Since the initial check returned the targets page HTML and the API endpoint shows active targets (though the grep for localhost:9100 failed), we need to confirm that the node exporter scrape job ('node') is active. This can be done by querying the Prometheus API and grepping for 'job':'node'.

We want to verify that Prometheus is scraping node exporter metrics by ensuring that the JSON output of the targets API includes a target with the job 'node'.
