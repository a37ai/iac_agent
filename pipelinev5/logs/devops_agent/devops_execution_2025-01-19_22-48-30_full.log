  "codebase_context": "Overview:\n# Comprehensive Overview of the Mono Repository\n\n## 1. Overall Architecture\n\n### High-level System Design\nThe repository is focused on provisioning AWS infrastructure using Terraform, an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool. The primary goal is to automate the creation of an EC2 instance, leveraging Terraform's declarative configuration.\n\n### Design Patterns and Principles\n- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The repository uses Terraform to define infrastructure in a declarative manner.\n- **Parameterization:** Use of variables to allow customization and flexibility in infrastructure setup.\n- **Modularity:** Separation of concerns with distinct files for variables, outputs, and main configuration.\n\n### System Boundaries and Interfaces\n- **AWS Interface:** The system interacts with AWS services to provision resources.\n- **Terraform Interface:** Utilizes Terraform CLI to apply configurations and manage infrastructure lifecycle.\n\n## 2. Development Infrastructure\n\n### Technology Stack\n- **Terraform:** Used for infrastructure provisioning.\n- **AWS:** Cloud provider for hosting resources.\n\n### Key Dependencies\n- **Terraform:** Required to execute the IaC scripts.\n- **AWS Provider:** Terraform plugin to interact with AWS services.\n\n### Development Tools and Requirements\n- **Terraform CLI:** For executing and managing Terraform configurations.\n- **AWS CLI:** Optional, for additional AWS management tasks.\n\n## 3. DevOps Infrastructure\n\n### Deployment Architecture\n- **IaC Deployment:** Infrastructure is deployed using Terraform scripts, which are executed to provision resources on AWS.\n\n### Infrastructure as Code Setup\n- **Terraform Configuration Files:** `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf` define the infrastructure setup.\n- **State Management:** `terraform.tfstate` and its backup are used to track the state of the infrastructure.\n\n### Configuration Management Approach\n- **Variables File:** `variables.tf` manages configuration parameters, allowing environment-specific customizations.\n\n### Service Dependencies and Integration Points\n- **AWS Services:** EC2 instances are provisioned as part of the infrastructure setup.\n\n## 4. Environment Management\n\n### Development, Staging, and Production Environments\n- **Environment-Specific Configurations:** Managed through variables, allowing different configurations for different environments.\n\n### Environment Promotion Strategy\n- **Manual Promotion:** Likely involves manual changes to variables for different environments.\n\n### Configuration and Secret Management\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for AWS credentials, but no explicit secret management strategy is detailed.\n\n## 5. CI/CD Pipeline\n\n### Build and Deployment Processes\n- **Terraform Apply:** The primary deployment process involves running Terraform commands to apply configurations.\n\n### Testing Strategies\n- **Infrastructure Testing:** Not explicitly mentioned, but could involve manual verification or automated tests using tools like Terratest.\n\n### Deployment Strategies\n- **Standard Deployment:** No advanced strategies like blue-green or canary deployments are mentioned.\n\n### Release Management\n- **Version Control:** Likely managed through Git, but not explicitly detailed in the analysis.\n\n## 6. Operational Considerations\n\n### Monitoring and Logging Setup\n- **Monitoring:** Not explicitly mentioned; could be improved with AWS CloudWatch integration.\n- **Logging:** No logging strategy detailed; consider using AWS CloudWatch Logs.\n\n### Security Measures\n- **AWS Credentials Management:** Environment variables are used, but a more secure approach like AWS Secrets Manager is recommended.\n\n### Scalability Provisions\n- **EC2 Instance Provisioning:** Basic setup; scalability could be improved with auto-scaling groups.\n\n### Backup and Disaster Recovery\n- **State File Backup:** `terraform.tfstate.backup` provides basic backup, but a more robust strategy is recommended.\n\n## 7. Areas for Improvement\n\n### Technical Debt\n- **Modularization:** Consider breaking down configurations into reusable modules.\n\n### Security Considerations\n- **Secrets Management:** Implement a more secure approach for managing AWS credentials and other sensitive data.\n\n### Scalability Concerns\n- **Auto-scaling:** Integrate auto-scaling for EC2 instances to handle varying loads.\n\n### DevOps Pipeline Optimization\n- **CI/CD Integration:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.\n- **Automated Testing:** Integrate infrastructure testing tools to validate configurations before deployment.\n\nThis analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the mono repository, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement in architecture, DevOps, and operational aspects.\n\nFile Structure:\n{\"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/terraform.tfstate.backup\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/outputs.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/terraform.tfstate\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/main.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/README.md\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/variables.tf\": \"file\"}\n\nRelevant Files:\n{\n  \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/variables.tf\": \"variable \\\"aws_region\\\" {\\n  description = \\\"AWS region\\\"\\n  default = \\\"us-west-1\\\"\\n}\\n\\nvariable \\\"ami_id\\\" {\\n  description = \\\"ID of the AMI to provision.

Overall Architecture\n\n### High-level System Design\nThe repository is focused on provisioning AWS infrastructure using Terraform, an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool. The primary goal is to automate the creation of an EC2 instance, leveraging Terraform's declarative configuration.\n\n### Design Patterns and Principles\n- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The repository uses Terraform to define infrastructure in a declarative manner.\n- **Parameterization:** Use of variables to allow customization and flexibility in infrastructure setup.\n- **Modularity:** Separation of concerns with distinct files for variables, outputs, and main configuration.\n\n### System Boundaries and Interfaces\n- **AWS Interface:** The system interacts with AWS services to provision resources.\n- **Terraform Interface:** Utilizes Terraform CLI to apply configurations and manage infrastructure lifecycle.\n\n## 2. Development Infrastructure\n\n### Technology Stack\n- **Terraform:** Used for infrastructure provisioning.\n- **AWS:** Cloud provider for hosting resources.\n\n### Key Dependencies\n- **Terraform:** Required to execute the IaC scripts.\n- **AWS Provider:** Terraform plugin to interact with AWS services.\n\n### Development Tools and Requirements\n- **Terraform CLI:** For executing and managing Terraform configurations.\n- **AWS CLI:** Optional, for additional AWS management tasks.\n\n## 3. DevOps Infrastructure\n\n### Deployment Architecture\n- **IaC Deployment:** Infrastructure is deployed using Terraform scripts, which are executed to provision resources on AWS.\n\n### Infrastructure as Code Setup\n- **Terraform Configuration Files:** `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf` define the infrastructure setup.\n- **State Management:** `terraform.tfstate` and its backup are used to track the state of the infrastructure.\n\n### Configuration Management Approach\n- **Variables File:** `variables.tf` manages configuration parameters, allowing environment-specific customizations.\n\n### Service Dependencies and Integration Points\n- **AWS Services:** EC2 instances are provisioned as part of the infrastructure setup.\n\n## 4. Environment Management\n\n### Development, Staging, and Production Environments\n- **Environment-Specific Configurations:** Managed through variables, allowing different configurations for different environments.\n\n### Environment Promotion Strategy\n- **Manual Promotion:** Likely involves manual changes to variables for different environments.\n\n### Configuration and Secret Management\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for AWS credentials, but no explicit secret management strategy is detailed.\n\n## 5. CI/CD Pipeline\n\n### Build and Deployment Processes\n- **Terraform Apply:** The primary deployment process involves running Terraform commands to apply configurations.\n\n### Testing Strategies\n- **Infrastructure Testing:** Not explicitly mentioned, but could involve manual verification or automated tests using tools like Terratest.\n\n### Deployment Strategies\n- **Standard Deployment:** No advanced strategies like blue-green or canary deployments are mentioned.\n\n### Release Management\n- **Version Control:** Likely managed through Git, but not explicitly detailed in the analysis.\n\n## 6. Operational Considerations\n\n### Monitoring and Logging Setup\n- **Monitoring:** Not explicitly mentioned; could be improved with AWS CloudWatch integration.\n- **Logging:** No logging strategy detailed; consider using AWS CloudWatch Logs.\n\n### Security Measures\n- **AWS Credentials Management:** Environment variables are used, but a more secure approach like AWS Secrets Manager is recommended.\n\n### Scalability Provisions\n- **EC2 Instance Provisioning:** Basic setup; scalability could be improved with auto-scaling groups.\n\n### Backup and Disaster Recovery\n- **State File Backup:** `terraform.tfstate.backup` provides basic backup, but a more robust strategy is recommended.\n\n## 7. Areas for Improvement\n\n### Technical Debt\n- **Modularization:** Consider breaking down configurations into reusable modules.\n\n### Security Considerations\n- **Secrets Management:** Implement a more secure approach for managing AWS credentials and other sensitive data.\n\n### Scalability Concerns\n- **Auto-scaling:** Integrate auto-scaling for EC2 instances to handle varying loads.\n\n### DevOps Pipeline Optimization\n- **CI/CD Integration:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.\n- **Automated Testing:** Integrate infrastructure testing tools to validate configurations before deployment.\n\nThis analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the mono repository, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement in architecture, DevOps, and operational aspects.\n\nFile Structure:\n{\"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/terraform.tfstate.backup\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/outputs.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/terraform.tfstate\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/main.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/README.md\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/variables.tf\": \"file\"}\n\nRelevant Files:\n{\n  \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/variables.tf\": \"variable \\\"aws_region\\\" {\\n  description = \\\"AWS region\\\"\\n  default = \\\"us-west-1\\\"\\n}\\n\\nvariable \\\"ami_id\\\" {\\n  description = \\\"ID of the AMI to provision.

The primary goal is to automate the creation of an EC2 instance, leveraging Terraform's declarative configuration.\n\n### Design Patterns and Principles\n- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The repository uses Terraform to define infrastructure in a declarative manner.\n- **Parameterization:** Use of variables to allow customization and flexibility in infrastructure setup.\n- **Modularity:** Separation of concerns with distinct files for variables, outputs, and main configuration.\n\n### System Boundaries and Interfaces\n- **AWS Interface:** The system interacts with AWS services to provision resources.\n- **Terraform Interface:** Utilizes Terraform CLI to apply configurations and manage infrastructure lifecycle.\n\n## 2. Development Infrastructure\n\n### Technology Stack\n- **Terraform:** Used for infrastructure provisioning.\n- **AWS:** Cloud provider for hosting resources.\n\n### Key Dependencies\n- **Terraform:** Required to execute the IaC scripts.\n- **AWS Provider:** Terraform plugin to interact with AWS services.\n\n### Development Tools and Requirements\n- **Terraform CLI:** For executing and managing Terraform configurations.\n- **AWS CLI:** Optional, for additional AWS management tasks.\n\n## 3. DevOps Infrastructure\n\n### Deployment Architecture\n- **IaC Deployment:** Infrastructure is deployed using Terraform scripts, which are executed to provision resources on AWS.\n\n### Infrastructure as Code Setup\n- **Terraform Configuration Files:** `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf` define the infrastructure setup.\n- **State Management:** `terraform.tfstate` and its backup are used to track the state of the infrastructure.\n\n### Configuration Management Approach\n- **Variables File:** `variables.tf` manages configuration parameters, allowing environment-specific customizations.\n\n### Service Dependencies and Integration Points\n- **AWS Services:** EC2 instances are provisioned as part of the infrastructure setup.\n\n## 4. Environment Management\n\n### Development, Staging, and Production Environments\n- **Environment-Specific Configurations:** Managed through variables, allowing different configurations for different environments.\n\n### Environment Promotion Strategy\n- **Manual Promotion:** Likely involves manual changes to variables for different environments.\n\n### Configuration and Secret Management\n- **Environment Variables:** Used for AWS credentials, but no explicit secret management strategy is detailed.\n\n## 5. CI/CD Pipeline\n\n### Build and Deployment Processes\n- **Terraform Apply:** The primary deployment process involves running Terraform commands to apply configurations.\n\n### Testing Strategies\n- **Infrastructure Testing:** Not explicitly mentioned, but could involve manual verification or automated tests using tools like Terratest.\n\n### Deployment Strategies\n- **Standard Deployment:** No advanced strategies like blue-green or canary deployments are mentioned.\n\n### Release Management\n- **Version Control:** Likely managed through Git, but not explicitly detailed in the analysis.\n\n## 6. Operational Considerations\n\n### Monitoring and Logging Setup\n- **Monitoring:** Not explicitly mentioned; could be improved with AWS CloudWatch integration.\n- **Logging:** No logging strategy detailed; consider using AWS CloudWatch Logs.\n\n### Security Measures\n- **AWS Credentials Management:** Environment variables are used, but a more secure approach like AWS Secrets Manager is recommended.\n\n### Scalability Provisions\n- **EC2 Instance Provisioning:** Basic setup; scalability could be improved with auto-scaling groups.\n\n### Backup and Disaster Recovery\n- **State File Backup:** `terraform.tfstate.backup` provides basic backup, but a more robust strategy is recommended.\n\n## 7. Areas for Improvement\n\n### Technical Debt\n- **Modularization:** Consider breaking down configurations into reusable modules.\n\n### Security Considerations\n- **Secrets Management:** Implement a more secure approach for managing AWS credentials and other sensitive data.\n\n### Scalability Concerns\n- **Auto-scaling:** Integrate auto-scaling for EC2 instances to handle varying loads.\n\n### DevOps Pipeline Optimization\n- **CI/CD Integration:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.\n- **Automated Testing:** Integrate infrastructure testing tools to validate configurations before deployment.\n\nThis analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the mono repository, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement in architecture, DevOps, and operational aspects.\n\nFile Structure:\n{\"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/terraform.tfstate.backup\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/outputs.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/terraform.tfstate\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/main.tf\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/README.md\": \"file\", \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/variables.tf\": \"file\"}\n\nRelevant Files:\n{\n  \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/outputs.tf\": \"output \\\"public_dns\\\" {\\n  value = \\\"${aws_instance.ubuntu.public_dns}\\\"\\n}\\n\",\n  \"/Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/variables.tf\": \"variable \\\"aws_region\\\" {\\n  description = \\\"AWS region\\\"\\n  default = \\\"us-west-1\\\"\\n}\\n\\nvariable \\\"ami_id\\\" {\\n  description = \\\"ID of the AMI to provision.
