Tagline: Ensuring Correct EC2 Configuration Addition
Summary: The changes to the main Terraform configuration file will be validated to confirm the correct addition of a new EC2 instance resource block. This step is crucial to ensure the modifications meet requirements and maintain code integrity.

Timestamp: 2025-01-26T17:57:09.443784
Tagline: Previewing Infrastructure Changes with Terraform
Summary: Running 'terraform plan' helps verify the correctness of the new EC2 instance configuration. This step ensures that the planned infrastructure changes are accurate before applying them.

Timestamp: 2025-01-26T17:57:13.747265
Tagline: Initialize Terraform to fix lock file
Summary: Running 'terraform init' will reinitialize the Terraform working directory, addressing the inconsistent dependency lock file issue. This step ensures the environment is ready for a successful 'terraform plan'.

Timestamp: 2025-01-26T17:57:32.737710
Tagline: Validating Infrastructure Configuration with Terraform
Summary: Executing 'terraform plan' to confirm the correctness of the infrastructure configuration post-initialization. This step helps identify potential changes and ensures the setup aligns with the intended design.

Timestamp: 2025-01-26T17:58:01.777906
Tagline: Re-evaluating Infrastructure Changes with Terraform
Summary: The 'terraform plan' command will be executed again to assess infrastructure changes after a timeout issue was resolved. This ensures that the planned modifications are accurately reflected following the successful initialization of Terraform.

Timestamp: 2025-01-26T17:58:12.828630
Tagline: Fixing syntax error in Terraform file
Summary: The Terraform configuration file contains a syntax error due to an incorrect block type for 'tags'. This will be corrected by using the appropriate map syntax to ensure proper functionality.

Timestamp: 2025-01-26T17:58:21.232642
Tagline: Validate and preview Terraform configuration changes
Summary: Running 'terraform plan' checks the corrected Terraform configuration for validity and previews any changes. This ensures that the syntax error is resolved and the desired infrastructure modifications are clear.

Timestamp: 2025-01-26T17:58:32.801139
Tagline: Fixing syntax error in Terraform file
Summary: The Terraform configuration file contains a syntax error related to an unsupported block type. This will be corrected by properly defining the tags as a map to ensure successful deployment.

Timestamp: 2025-01-26T17:58:39.116695
Tagline: Validating Terraform configuration changes
Summary: Running 'terraform plan' checks the corrected configuration for validity and previews potential changes. This ensures that syntax errors are resolved and the desired infrastructure modifications are clear.

Timestamp: 2025-01-26T17:58:45.289562
Tagline: Provisioning infrastructure with Terraform plan
Summary: The Terraform plan has been validated successfully, confirming the correctness of the configuration. The next step is to apply this plan to provision the necessary resources as specified.

Timestamp: 2025-01-26T18:00:02.055765
Tagline: Retrying Terraform Deployment for Success
Summary: The previous Terraform apply attempt failed despite a successful plan. Retrying the apply command may resolve the issue and successfully implement the infrastructure changes.

Timestamp: 2025-01-26T18:00:26.602690
Tagline: Retrying Terraform for EC2 provisioning
Summary: The Terraform configuration will be reapplied to provision EC2 instances after previous failures. This action aims to resolve transient issues or identify persistent errors.

Timestamp: 2025-01-26T18:00:46.297950
Tagline: Requesting human expertise for Terraform errors
Summary: Human intervention is needed to investigate persistent errors occurring during the 'terraform apply' process. Despite successful planning, these errors suggest deeper issues in the AWS environment or Terraform configuration.
