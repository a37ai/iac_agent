description:
Create a GitHub Actions workflow file for CI in the specified directory.

content:
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2

        node-version: '14'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test

reasoning:
The current step requires creating a GitHub Actions workflow file for continuous integration. The content for the workflow is provided, and the file path is specified as '.github/workflows/ci.yml'. Creating this file will set up the CI pipeline as described.

reasoning:
The previous attempts to check the Docker service status using systemctl failed because the command is not found. The service command also failed previously, but it might be due to a different shell environment. Let's try starting the Docker service using the service command to see if it resolves the issue.
