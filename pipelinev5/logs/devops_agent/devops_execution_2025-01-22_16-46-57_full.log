Step 2:
Description: Add necessary variables for EC2 instance configuration in the variables file
Type: code
Files: /Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/variables.tf

Step 3:
Description: Update the outputs file to expose the public DNS of the new EC2 instance
Type: code
Files: /Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/outputs.tf

Step 4:
Description: Run Terraform commands to apply the changes and provision the EC2 instance

Add the EC2 instance configuration to the Terraform main configuration file.

content:
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = var.ami_id
  instance_type = var.instance_type

  tags = {
    Name = var.name
  }
}

reasoning:
The task requires adding a new EC2 instance configuration to the existing Terraform main configuration file. This involves inserting the provided resource block into the 'main.tf' file to define the new AWS instance.
