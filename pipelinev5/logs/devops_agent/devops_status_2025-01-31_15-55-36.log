Tagline: Creating a functional Prometheus installer
Summary: The empty install_prometheus.yml playbook will be populated with tasks to install Prometheus using Homebrew on MacOS. This ensures successful execution by Ansible and verifies Prometheus installation.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T15:58:42.922816
Tagline: Deploying Prometheus with Ansible on macOS
Summary: The updated Ansible playbook will be executed to install Prometheus using Homebrew on macOS. This step ensures that the modifications are correct and Prometheus is installed successfully.

Timestamp: 2025-01-31T15:59:03.098013
Tagline: Investigating Empty Prometheus Playbook Issue
