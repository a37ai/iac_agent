Fetch the latest changes from the remote GitHub repository to ensure the local repository is up-to-date.

content:
git fetch origin

reasoning:
Fetching the latest changes from the remote repository is necessary to ensure that the local repository is synchronized with the remote state. This is a standard practice before making any changes or deployments to ensure that we are working with the most recent codebase.

reasoning:
The error indicates that 'origin/main' is not a valid reference. This could be due to the branch being named differently, such as 'origin/master'. We need to list the remote branches to determine the correct branch name.

reasoning:
The previous attempt to check out the main.tf file failed because the branch 'origin/main' does not exist. The available remote branch is 'origin/forge', so we should use this branch to retrieve the file.

Re-run the diff command to capture the actual differences between the files.

content:
diff /Users/rithvikprakki/iac_agent/pipelinev5/test_repos/main.tf /tmp/remote_main.tf

reasoning:
The previous execution of the diff command did not capture the output, which is necessary to understand the differences between the local and remote main.tf files. Re-running the command will allow us to capture and analyze the differences.

Validate the output of the diff command to ensure the comparison was successful and identify any differences.

content:
The output of the diff command should be checked to see if there are any differences between the local and remote main.tf files. If there are differences, they will be displayed in the output. If there are no differences, the output will be empty.

reasoning:
The diff command was executed multiple times, but the output was not properly validated to determine if there are any differences between the local and remote main.tf files. By validating the output, we can confirm whether the files are identical or if there are changes that need to be addressed.
