Tagline: Fixing Terraform tags syntax error
Summary: The syntax error in the Terraform configuration is due to the incorrect use of a block for 'tags' instead of an argument. Correcting this will ensure the Terraform plan executes without errors, improving deployment reliability.

Timestamp: 2025-01-19T16:10:19.096772
Tagline: Validate corrected Terraform configuration changes
Summary: Running 'terraform plan' checks the configuration after fixing syntax errors to ensure validity. This step confirms the proposed infrastructure changes are correct before applying them.

Timestamp: 2025-01-19T16:10:28.738736
Tagline: EC2 Configuration Successfully Updated
Summary: The addition of a new EC2 instance configuration to the Terraform main file for the development environment has been completed without issues. The Terraform plan command confirmed the configuration's validity, requiring no further actions at this time.

Timestamp: 2025-01-19T16:10:34.984994
Tagline: Updating environment variables for consistency
Summary: The development environment variables file will be updated to ensure the correct settings for the new EC2 instance. This ensures consistency and correctness in the deployment process.

Timestamp: 2025-01-19T16:10:42.870784
Tagline: All development tasks successfully finalized
