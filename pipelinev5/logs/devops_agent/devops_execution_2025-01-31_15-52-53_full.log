Execute 'brew --version' to check if Homebrew is installed on the local Mac OS.

content:
None

reasoning:
We need to verify if Homebrew is installed and identify its version by running 'brew --version'. This is an essential check for the environment setup on a Mac OS.

description:
Initialize Terraform in the repository.

content:
None

reasoning:
Homebrew was confirmed to be installed. The next logical step in setting up the DevOps infrastructure is to initialize Terraform, especially since the repository contains several Terraform configuration files (main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf). This will set up the backend and prepare to provision any infrastructure as code changes.
