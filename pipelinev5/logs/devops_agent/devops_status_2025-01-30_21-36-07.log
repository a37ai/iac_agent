Started at: 2025-01-30T21:36:07.612907

Timestamp: 2025-01-30T21:36:14.462846
Tagline: CI Workflow Setup Successfully Completed
Summary: The GitHub Actions workflow file for continuous integration has been successfully created, fulfilling the current requirements. No additional steps or instructions are pending at this time.

Timestamp: 2025-01-30T21:36:26.852277
Tagline: Set up Docker for user access
Summary: Docker will be installed and the current user will be added to the Docker group. This allows running Docker commands without sudo, facilitating containerized development workflows.

Timestamp: 2025-01-30T21:37:07.814680
Tagline: Verify Docker Daemon Operational Status
Summary: The Docker daemon's status will be checked to ensure it is running properly. This step is crucial to diagnose the '[Errno 32] Broken pipe' error encountered during Docker installation and usermod command execution.

Timestamp: 2025-01-30T21:37:15.494916
Tagline: Verifying Docker Daemon Operational Status
Summary: The Docker daemon's status is being checked to ensure it is running correctly. This action addresses a potential issue indicated by a previous error message, '[Errno 32] Broken pipe'.

Timestamp: 2025-01-30T21:37:23.970648
Tagline: Investigating Docker socket for errors
Summary: This action involves checking the Docker socket's existence and permissions to troubleshoot a broken pipe error during Docker installation. Identifying socket issues can help resolve permission problems or confirm if the socket is missing.

Timestamp: 2025-01-30T21:37:31.363193
Tagline: Verify Docker daemon status without systemctl
Summary: Since 'systemctl' is unavailable, we will use 'service docker status' to check if the Docker daemon is running. This alternative method ensures we can confirm the operational status of Docker on the system.

Timestamp: 2025-01-30T21:37:38.328844
Tagline: Attempting Docker service start workaround
Summary: The systemctl command is unavailable, preventing Docker service status checks. We will try starting the Docker service using the service command to resolve the issue.

Timestamp: 2025-01-30T21:37:47.137935
Tagline: Directly verifying Docker installation status
Summary: The system will check Docker's status using the Docker command itself, as previous methods failed. This approach ensures accurate verification of Docker's installation and operational status.
