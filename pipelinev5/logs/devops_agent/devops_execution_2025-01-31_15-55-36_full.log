Checking if Homebrew is installed on the Mac OS system by running 'brew --version'.

content:
None

reasoning:
We need to verify the installation of Homebrew before proceeding with further tasks on the Mac system. Running 'brew --version' will help confirm if Homebrew is available and provide its version if installed.

reasoning:
Since Homebrew is installed, the next step is to verify if Ansible is available to run the ansible playbooks (like the Prometheus setup) contained in our repository. This command will determine if Ansible is present or if we need to install it.

Given that Homebrew and Ansible have been verified as installed, and considering the repository contains an Ansible playbook for installing Prometheus (which is key to our monitoring setup), the next logical step is to run this playbook. This will initiate the installation and configuration of Prometheus as outlined in our DevOps plan.

reasoning:
The previous execution of the playbook failed because no inventory was specified, resulting in only the implicit localhost being available. Since we are deploying on macOS and likely targeting localhost, specifying '-i localhost,' should resolve this issue.

Populate the empty install_prometheus.yml playbook with valid content to install Prometheus via Homebrew on MacOS.

None

reasoning:
The previous ansible-playbook execution failed because the file install_prometheus.yml is empty. To proceed, we need a valid playbook that includes tasks (e.g., installing Prometheus using Homebrew) so that Ansible can run it correctly. The new playbook will install Prometheus and verify its installation.

Check the content of the 'install_prometheus.yml' playbook to verify if it has valid content.

content:
None

reasoning:
Since previous attempts to populate the file didn't result in any content (the playbook is still reported as empty), it's necessary to inspect the file content to understand why it's empty before proceeding.

Populate the install_prometheus.yml playbook with a valid playbook to install Prometheus via Homebrew on MacOS.

content:
None

reasoning:
The previous attempts to run the playbook resulted in an error stating 'Empty playbook, nothing to do'. We need to provide a proper Ansible playbook that will instruct the system to install Prometheus using Homebrew. This playbook will include a play for the localhost and a task using the homebrew module to install Prometheus.
